SUBMIT PROPOSAL TO:  City of La Mirada Attn: City Clerk’s Office 13700 La Mirada Blvd. La Mirada, CA 90638 (562) 943 – 0131    \f",
      "City of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  2   I. REQUEST SUMMARY  The City of La Mirada is seeking proposals from firms to provide investment advisory and portfolio management services for approximately $75 million in operating and capital funds (non-pension).  The term will be three years, with two one year options, which may be exercised at the City’s discretion.  The selected firm(s) will be responsible for performing in accordance with the scope of services, as further detailed in Section III.  II. INTRODUCTION A. Community Profile  The City was incorporated in 1960 and is a general law city with a population of approximately 49,000. The City Council is comprised of five elected citizens, with the City Manager as the administrative and executive head of the City. The City employs 73 full-time employees and approximately 300 part-time employees.  The City of La Mirada provides public safety services, public works, parks and community services, planning, building and safety, and code enforcement. The City’s award winning Theatre for the Performing Arts and Splash! La Mirada Regional Aquatics Center provide exceptional cultural and recreational opportunities for residents and guests. The City contracts with Los Angeles County for law enforcement, animal control and building services.  The total adopted budget for Fiscal Year 2018-19 is approximately $72 million, excluding transfers, of which $35.6 million are General Fund expenditures.    B. Background  The City’s primary investment objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on public funds while minimizing the potential for capital losses arising from market changes or issuer default. Although the generation of revenues through interest earnings on investments is an appropriate City goal, the primary consideration in the investment of City funds is capital preservation in the overall portfolio. As such, the City’s yield objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on City investments rather than the maximum generation of income, which could expose the City to unacceptable levels of risk.  While the City has utilized a vendor for this service since 2008, this RFP is being issued in compliance with internal requirements to periodically solicit proposals.   C. General RFP Submittal Information  The City’s designated staff will evaluate proposals received. During the review process, the City reserves the right, where it may serve the City’s best interest, to request additional information or clarification from those that submit proposals, or \f",
      "City of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  3   allow clarifications, corrections of errors, or omissions. Any and all changes in the RFP will be made by written addendum, which shall be issued by the City to all prospective proposers who have registered for the RFP via the City’s website.  The City reserves the right to retain all proposals submitted. Submission of a proposal indicates the proposer’s acceptance of the conditions contained in this RFP, unless clearly and specifically noted in the proposal submitted and confirmed in the contract between the City and the proposer selected.  The preparation of the proposal will be at the total expense of the proposer. There is no expressed or implied obligation for the City to reimburse responding proposers for any expense incurred in the preparation of proposals in response to this request. All proposals submitted to the City shall become properties of the City and will not be returned. If any information in a proposal is confidential and/or proprietary, please further submit a separate, redacted copy for servicing public records requests.  The proposer may submit an alternative proposal (or proposals) that it believes will also meet the City's project objectives; but in a different way. In this case, the proposer must provide an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the alternatives, and discuss under what circumstances the City would prefer one alternative to the other(s). If an alternative proposal is submitted, the maximum length of the proposal may be expanded proportionately by the number of alternatives submitted.  The City reserves the right to reject any or all proposals, in whole or part, to waive any informality in any proposal, and to accept the proposal which, in its discretion, is in the best interest of the City. Any proposer may withdraw his/her proposal, without obligation, at any time prior to the scheduled closing time for receipt of proposals. A withdrawal will not be effective unless made personally, telephonic, or electronic notification received prior to the closing date. Proposals may later be referred to the City Council for appropriate action.

      "Revised August 2018*   1 – 25  TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TERMS AND CONDITIONS PART 1.  INTRODUCTION 1.01  GENERAL:  These Terms and Conditions shall apply to all solicitations for goods and/or services [including without limitation any Request for Quote (RFQ), Invitation for Bids (IFB), Request for Offer (RFO) and Request for Proposal (RFP)] offered by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) (each, a “solicitation”) and any purchase order issued by TxDOT (“purchase order” or “contract”). The term “response” or “bid” shall mean the proposal, quote, bid, or offer made to TxDOT in response to a solicitation.   The term “respondent” or “bidder” shall mean any party who makes a response to a solicitation, including the vendor. The term “vendor” or “contractor” shall mean the party listed as vendor on the purchase order. 1.02  STATUTORY AUTHORITY:  This procurement falls under the statutory authority of Government Code Chapter 2151 (commonly known as the “Purchasing Act”), Chapter 2155 (Purchasing:  General Rules and Procedures), Chapter 2157 (Purchasing Methods) and Chapter 2161 (Historically Underutilized Businesses, “HUBs”).  The purchasing procedures include statutory requirements and those requirements established by rule of the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts (CPA), Statewide Procurement Division (SPD) as contained in 34 TAC §20.31 and other applicable Federal and State statues and rules herein cited. 1.03  TITLE VI ASSURANCE:  TxDOT, in accordance with the provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (78 Stat. 252, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d to 2000d-4) and 49 C.F.R. Part 21 and 28 CFR Section 50.3 (for purposes of this Section and Section 6.10 only, the “Acts” and the “Regulations,” respectively), hereby notifies all bidders that it will affirmatively ensure that in any contract entered into pursuant to this advertisement,  disadvantaged business enterprises will be afforded full and fair opportunity to submit bids in response to this invitation  and will not be discriminated against on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, in consideration for an award. Nondiscrimination programs require that federal-aid recipients, sub-recipients, and contractors prevent discrimination and ensure nondiscrimination in all of their programs and activities, whether those programs and activities are federally-funded or not. 1.04  ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT:  It is the intent of TxDOT to purchase goods, equipment, and services having the least adverse environmental impact within the constraints of statutory purchasing requirements, departmental need, availability, and sound economical considerations in accordance with 34 TAC §20.307 and 20.306. 1.05  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS:  The vendor shall comply with all federal, state, and local laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, and the orders and decrees of any court or administrative bodies or tribunals in any matter affecting the performance of the purchase order, including if applicable, workers’ compensation laws, minimum and maximum salary and wage statutes and regulations, prompt payment and licensing laws and regulations.  The vendor shall maintain all required licenses, certifications, etc. throughout the term of the purchase order.  When required, the vendor shall furnish TxDOT with satisfactory proof of its compliance. PART 2.  GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 2.01  SPECIFICATIONS (a) The respondent shall carefully examine the solicitation.  The respondent shall be responsible for securing any additional information from the TxDOT purchaser needed to gain a clear and full understanding of TxDOT’s requirements. \f",
      "Revised August 2018*   2 – 25  (b) TxDOT will not be bound by any oral statement or representation contrary to the written specifications of the solicitation.

(d) Any catalog, brand name or manufacturer’s reference used in the solicitation is descriptive only (not restrictive), and is used to indicate type and quality desired.  Responses on brands of like nature and quality will be considered unless advertised as proprietary or sole source under Texas Government Code Section 2155.067.  The respondent shall show manufacturer, brand or trade name, and other description of the product offered in response to the solicitation.  If offer is for other than example(s) shown in the solicitation, include illustration(s) and complete description(s) of product(s) in the response to the solicitation.

(g) E-mailed responses may be accepted if stated on the solicitation.  E-mailed responses must be in Portable Document Format (pdf), signed by the respondent and attached to the e-mail to be considered for award. (h) RESPONDENT EXCEPTIONS OR CONDITIONED RESPONSES:  Exceptions taken by the respondent to TxDOT’s Terms and Conditions or respondent’s Terms and Conditions attached to a response will not be considered unless specifically referred to and clearly identified as such within the response.  TxDOT may reject a response that takes exception to TxDOT’s Terms and Conditions. (i) TxDOT reserves the right to accept or reject all or any part of any response, waive minor technicalities and make an award to best serve the interests of the State.  TxDOT reserves the right to reject any response not prepared and submitted in accordance with the solicitation requirements. (j) Response should indicate number of days required to deliver goods, or begin service (if required), at TxDOT’s designated location.  Failure to indicate delivery time obligates vendor to complete delivery in fourteen (14) calendar days. (k) Samples, when requested must be furnished at no cost to TxDOT.  TxDOT may perform tests on samples. If not destroyed in testing, samples will be returned upon request at respondent’s expense.  Each sample shall be marked with respondent’s name and address, and TxDOT solicitation number.  Samples shall not be enclosed or attached to a response unless specified in the solicitation. 2.03  PRICING (a) TxDOT’s automated purchasing system requires pricing to be submitted per unit, multiplied by the quantity and extended.  Unit prices shall govern in the event of extension errors.  If a trade discount is offered on the solicitation response, it should be deducted and net line extensions should be shown. (b) All prices shall be firm for thirty (30) days from the solicitation response date unless otherwise stated in the solicitation.  “Discount from list” pricing is not acceptable unless requested.  Cash discounts are acceptable, but are not considered in making an award. (c) All purchases are on a firm, fixed price basis unless otherwise stated in the solicitation.

Vendor shall not perform any work that may exceed either the purchase order total or the not-to-exceed total without prior written authorization from TxDOT. \f",
      "Revised August 2018*   4 – 25  (h) Consistent and continued tie response pricing may lead to rejection of the response by TxDOT and investigation for antitrust violations. 2.04  ADA CONSIDERATIONS AND NOTIFICATION:  Persons with special needs or disabilities who plan to attend any pre-response conference or bid opening and who require auxiliary aids or service should contact the purchaser noted on the solicitation as the point of contact a minimum of three (3) days prior to the meeting so arrangements can be made. 2.05  RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS AND BID OPENINGS (a) NEGOTIATED SOLICITATIONS:  At the time of opening or closing for RFOs or RFPs, only the names of respondents will be announced.  Prices will not be disclosed. (b) NON-NEGOTIATED SOLICITATIONS:  At the time of opening or closing for IFBs, names of respondents will be announced.  Prices will be disclosed. (c) DISCLOSURE OF RESPONSE:  Information submitted in an accepted response will not be returned to the respondent.  The Public Information Act (PIA), Government Code Chapter 552, allows the public to have access to information in the possession of a governmental body through an open records request.  Therefore, the respondent shall clearly identify in the response any confidential or proprietary information.  Proprietary information identified by the respondent in the response, will be kept confidential by TxDOT to the extent permitted by state law.  TxDOT merely raises the exception on behalf of the vendor.  TxDOT takes no legal position on disclosure.  TxDOT will use best efforts to give the respondent or the awarded vendor an opportunity to present to the Office of the Attorney General its arguments for non-disclosure of its identified confidential or proprietary information. 2.06  ALTERATIONS OR WITHDRAWAL OF RESPONSES (a) Any alterations to a response made before the opening or closing date and time shall be initialed by respondent or authorized agent.  Response cannot be altered or amended after the opening or closing date and time. (b) A response may be withdrawn if requested in writing prior to the opening or closing date and time.  A response may be withdrawn from consideration after the opening or closing date only with the approval of TxDOT based on respondent’s written, acceptable reason.  The response will not be considered for award but will be retained by TxDOT according to the response information confidentiality provision referenced in Section 2.05 (c). 2.07  DETERMINING AWARD:  A response to a solicitation is an offer to contract with TxDOT based upon the terms, conditions and specifications contained in the solicitation.  Responses do not become contracts unless and until they are accepted through an authorized TxDOT designee by issuance of a purchase order.  In determining the best value for the state, the purchase price and whether the goods or services meet specifications are the most important considerations, unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. (a) BEST VALUE CRITERIA FOR PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES:  When specified in the solicitation, the factors listed in Government Code Section 2155.074 will be considered in making a best value award.  This section allows TxDOT to apply best value criteria in order to obtain goods and services that provide the best value for TxDOT.  Under these guidelines, a respondent is not automatically awarded a purchase order if they submit the lowest bid response.  TxDOT will be the sole judge as to which response is the most advantageous and in the best interest of TxDOT.  In determining best value, factors other than price may be considered in making an award.  Those factors are: (1) life cycle costs; (2) the quality and reliability of goods and services; (3) the delivery terms; \f",
      "Revised August 2018*   5 – 25  (4) indicators of probable vendor performance; (5) cost of employee training associated with a purchase; (6) the effect of a purchase on agency productivity; and (7) other factors relevant to determining best value for the state in the context of a particular purchase. (b) BEST VALUE CRITERIA FOR RFO PURCHASES:  Best value criteria will be used on all information technology equipment or service purchases.  Those best value criteria include but are not limited to: (1) compatibility to facilitate exchange of existing data; (2) capacity for expansion and upgrading to more advanced levels of technology; (3) quantitative reliability factors; (4) level of training required to bring end-users to a stated level of proficiency; (5) technical support requirements for maintenance of data across a network platform and management of the networks hardware and software; (6) items, features, etc., which are in addition to requirements listed, as well as factors which, in TxDOT’s opinion, add value to the product or service but are not specifically required within the solicitation. (c) NEGOTIATIONS FOR RFO AND RFP PURCHASES:  TxDOT reserves the right to conduct formal negotiations with respondent(s) judged to have the best offer pertaining to price, goods, services and terms. (d) TxDOT reserves the right to reject a response from a respondent whose goods or services to TxDOT or other state agencies have been documented as unsatisfactory in providing the same goods or service. (e) TIE RESPONSES:  In case of tie responses, one or more preferences described in Government Code Chapter 2155 and 34 TAC §20.306 will be used to make an award.  Tie responses which cannot be resolved by application of one or more preferences shall be made by drawing lots. 2.08  PREFERENCES:  A respondent may claim a preference under 34 TAC §20.306.  To claim a preference, a respondent shall identify the preference on the solicitation or on the response to the solicitation.  If the appropriate area on the solicitation or response is not marked, a preference will not be granted unless other documents included in the response show a right to the preference. 2.09  DELIVERY:  No substitutions or cancellations will be permitted without written approval from TxDOT, which approval must be issued in the form of a purchase order change notice issued by TxDOT’s purchasing department. (a) If delay is foreseen, vendor shall give written notice to TxDOT.  TxDOT has the right to extend delivery or service date if reasons appear valid.  Vendor shall keep TxDOT advised at all times of the status of the order. Default in promised delivery or service date (unless vendor has received a written extension of the delivery or service date which has been signed by TxDOT), or failure to meet specifications, authorizes  TxDOT to purchase goods or services elsewhere and charge the full increase, if any, in cost and handling to defaulting vendor. (b) Delivery shall be made between 8 AM and 4 PM Monday through Friday except on regularly observed state or federal holidays, unless prior approval has been obtained from TxDOT or otherwise stated in the solicitation. (c) Receipt of goods or services does not constitute acceptance. (d) Goods and materials shall be properly packaged.  Damaged goods and materials will not be accepted.  If the damage is not readily apparent at the time of delivery, the goods shall be returned to the vendor at no cost to TxDOT.  TxDOT reserves the right to inspect goods at a \f",
      "Revised August 2018*   6 – 25  reasonable time subsequent to delivery where circumstances or conditions prevent effective inspection of the goods at the time of delivery. 2.10  INSPECTIONS AND TESTS:  Goods will be subject to inspection and test by TxDOT to the extent practicable at all times and places.  Tests will be performed on samples taken from regular shipment.  In the event samples tested fail to meet all conditions and requirements of the specification, the cost of the sample used and the cost of the testing shall be borne by the vendor.  Goods which have been delivered and rejected in whole or in part may, at TxDOT’s option, be returned to the vendor or held for disposition at vendor’s risk and expense.  Latent defects may result in revocation of acceptance.   Acceptance of services shall be based on attainment of performance in accord with specifications and the purchase order. 2.11  VENDOR PERFORMANCE:  State agencies shall report a vendor's performance on any purchase of $25,000 or more from contracts administered by the commission or any other purchase made through an agency's delegated authority or a purchase made pursuant to the authority in Government Code, Title 10, Subtitle D or a purchase exempt from CPA/SPD procurement rules and procedures.  Past Performance:  A Respondent's past performance will be measured based upon pass/fail criteria, in compliance with applicable provisions of §2155.074, 2155.075, 2156.007, 2157.003, and 2157.125, Government Code. Respondents may fail this selection criterion for any of the following conditions:  • A letter grade score below ‘C’ in the Vendor Performance System, or a score of “legacy unsatisfactory” for historic reports submitted prior to the implementation of the current rating system,  • Being currently under a Corrective Action Plan through the CPA, • Having repeated negative Vendor Performance Reports for the same reason, • Having purchase orders that have been cancelled or terminated in the previous 12 months for non-performance (i.e. late delivery, etc.).  Vendor performance information is located on the CPA website at: http://www.txsmartbuy.com/vpts  TxDOT may conduct reference checks with other entities regarding past performance. In addition to evaluating performance through the Vendor Performance Tracking System (as authorized by 34 Texas Administrative Code §20.108) TxDOT may examine other sources of vendor performance including, but not limited to, notices of termination, cure notices, assessments of liquidated damages, litigation, audit reports, and non-renewals of contracts.  Any such investigations shall be at the sole discretion of TxDOT, and any negative findings, as determined by TxDOT, may result in non-award to the Respondent. PART 3.  RESPONDENT AFFIRMATIONS 3.01  FALSE STATEMENTS:  Respondent represents and warrants that all statements and information prepared and submitted in response to the solicitation are current, complete, true and accurate.  Signing the response to the solicitation with a false statement is a material breach of contract and shall void the submitted response or any resulting contracts, and may result in removal of the respondent from the Centralized Master Bidders List. 3.02  CONFORMANCE:  The respondent warrants to TxDOT that all goods and services furnished shall conform in all respects to the terms of this purchase order, including any drawings, specifications or standards incorporated herein, and any defects in materials, workmanship, and free from such defects in design.  In addition, respondent warrants that goods and services are suitable for and will perform in accordance with the purposes for which they are intended. 3.03  GRATUITIES:  The respondent has not given, offered to give, nor intends to give at any time hereafter any economic opportunity, future employment, gift, loan, gratuity, special discount, trip, favor, or service to a public servant in connection with the submitted response to the solicitation. \f",
      "Revised August 2018*   7 – 25  3.04  CERTAIN BIDS AND CONTRACTS PROHIBITED:  Under Government Code Section 2155.004, a state agency may not accept a bid or award a contract that includes proposed financial participation by a person who received compensation from the agency to participate in preparing the specifications or solicitation on which the bid or contract is based.

(h) The vendor shall post on each project site a notice, in the text, form and manner prescribed by the Texas Workers' Compensation Commission, informing all persons providing services on the project that they are required to be covered, and stating how a person may verify coverage and report lack of coverage.  (i) The vendor shall contractually require each person with whom it contracts to provide services on a project, to: (1) provide coverage, based on proper reporting of classification codes and payroll amounts and filing of any coverage agreements, which meets the statutory requirements of Texas \f",
      "Revised August 2018*   18 – 25  Labor Code, Section 401.011(44) for all of its employees providing services on the project, for the duration of the project;  (2) provide to the vendor, prior to that person beginning work on the project, a certificate of coverage showing that coverage is being provided for all employees of the person providing services on the project, for the duration of the project;  (3) provide the vendor, prior to the end of the coverage period, a new certificate of coverage showing extension of coverage, if the coverage period shown on the current certificate of coverage ends during the duration of the project;  (4) obtain from each other person with whom it contracts, and provide to the vendor: (a) a certificate of coverage, prior to the other person beginning work on the project; and (b) a new certificate of coverage showing extension of coverage, prior to the end of the coverage period, if the coverage period shown on the current certificate of coverage ends during the duration of the project;  (5) retain all required certificates of coverage on file for the duration of the project and for one year thereafter;  (6) notify TxDOT in writing by certified mail or personal delivery, within 10 days after the person knew or should have known, of any change that materially affects the provision of coverage of any person providing services on the project; and (7) contractually require each person with whom it contracts, to perform as required by paragraphs (1) - (7), with the certificates of coverage to be provided to the person for whom they are providing services.  (j) By signing the purchase order or providing or causing to be provided a certificate of coverage, the vendor is representing to TxDOT that all employees of the vendor who will provide services on the project will be covered by workers' compensation coverage for the duration of the project, that the coverage will be based on proper reporting of classification codes and payroll amounts, and that all coverage agreements will be filed with the appropriate insurance carrier or, in the case of a self-insured, with the commission's Division of Self-Insurance Regulation. Providing false or misleading information may subject the vendor to administrative penalties, criminal penalties, civil penalties, or other civil actions.  (k) The vendor's failure to comply with any of these provisions is a breach of contract by the vendor which entitles TxDOT to declare the purchase order void if the vendor does not remedy the breach within ten days after receipt of notice of breach from the governmental entity. 5.06  COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE:  Bodily Injury/Property Damage.  Required coverage shall at a minimum, be inclusive of the limits listed on the insurance form noted on the solicitation. 5.07  COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE POLICY:   Required coverage shall at a minimum, be inclusive of the limits listed on the insurance form noted on the solicitation. PART 6.  VENDOR PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 6.01  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR:  It is expressly understood and agreed to by both parties that TxDOT is contracting with the vendor as an independent contractor.  As such, vendor understands and agrees that individuals performing services in connection with the purchase order are not state employees, and that the vendor shall be responsible and liable for the safety, injury, and health of its and its subcontractor’s working personnel while its employees or subcontractor’s employees are performing work for TxDOT.  Should the vendor subcontract any of the services required in the purchase order, the vendor expressly acknowledges and agrees that TxDOT is in no manner liable to any subcontractor of the vendor.  In no event shall this provision relieve vendor of the responsibility for ensuring that all services rendered under all subcontracts are rendered in compliance with the contract. \f",

All employees of the vendor shall be a minimum of seventeen (17) years of age and experienced in the type of work to be performed.

All employees shall be well-groomed and appropriately dressed when on TxDOT property. 6.07  FELONY CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS:  Vendor represents and warrants that neither vendor nor any of vendor’s employees have been convicted of a felony criminal offense, or that, if such a conviction has occurred, vendor has fully advised TxDOT as to the facts and circumstances surrounding the conviction and vendor agrees to defend, hold harmless, and indemnify TxDOT from any loss or claim due to any such employees. 6.08  SUBCONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS:  In accordance with Government Code Sections 2161.181-182 and  34 TAC §20.11 and pursuant to the CPA Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) Rules, 34 TAC §20.14, and Transportation DBE/HUB/SBE Rules, 43 TAC 9.50-.57 (relating to Disadvantaged Business Enterprises, HUB and Small Business Enterprises, DBE/HUB/SBE) all state agencies entering into a contract with an expected value of $100,000 or more over the life of the contract (including renewals) shall, before the agency solicits bids, proposals, offers, or other applicable expressions of interest, determine if it is probable for subcontracting opportunities under the contract.  If subcontracting opportunities are probable the state agency will state such probability in its bids, proposals, offers, or other applicable expression of interest and require the submission of a HUB Subcontracting Plan (HSP).  The HSP, if acceptable to the agency, will be a provision of the contract.  The HSP, if required, may be found at:  http://www.dot.state.tx.us/gsd/purchasing/purchasing.htm. 6.09  PAYMENT OF SUBCONTRACTORS:  As provided by Government Code Section 2251.022 Time for Payment by Vendor: (a) A vendor who receives a payment from a governmental entity shall pay a subcontractor the appropriate share of the payment not later than the 10th day after the date the vendor receives the payment.

      "Revised August 2018*   20 – 25  6.10  VENDOR TITLE VI AFFIRMATIONS:  The vendor represents and warrants the following with regard to the work performed by it under the purchase order: (a) Vendor and its subcontractors shall not discriminate on the grounds of race, color, national origin, creed, religion, political belief, sex, sexual orientation, age, or disability in the performance of this contract, including without limitation in the selection and retention of subcontractors, including procurements of materials and leases of equipment.  The vendor shall not participate either directly or indirectly in any discriminatory employment practices.  Failure by the vendor to carry out these requirements is a material breach of any contract awarded and may result in the termination of the contract or such other remedy as TxDOT deems appropriate. (b) In any solicitations for subcontractors, including procurements of materials or leases of equipment and in all solicitations either by competitive bidding or negotiation made by the vendor for work to be performed under a subcontract, each potential subcontractor or supplier shall be notified by the vendor of the vendor’s and subcontractor’s obligations under its purchase order relative to nondiscrimination on the grounds of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability. (c) During the performance of this contract, the contractor, for itself, its assignees and successors in interest (hereinafter referred to collectively in this subsection (c) as the “contractor”) agrees as follows: (1) Compliance with Regulations:  The contractor will comply with the Acts and the Regulations relative to Nondiscrimination in Federally-assisted programs of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, as they may be amended from time to time, which are herein incorporated by reference and made a part of this contract. (2) Nondiscrimination:  The contractor, with regard to the work performed by it during the contract, will not discriminate on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in the selection and retention of subcontractors, including procurements of materials and leases of equipment.  The contractor will not participate either directly or indirectly in the discrimination prohibited by the Acts and the Regulations, including employment practices when the contract covers any activity, project, or program set forth in Appendix B of  49 CFR Part 21. (3) Solicitations for Subcontracts, Including Procurements of Materials and Equipment:  In all solicitations, either by competitive bidding, or negotiation made by the contractor for work to be performed under a subcontract, including procurements of materials, or leases of equipment, each potential subcontractor or supplier will be notified by the contractor of the contractor’s obligations under this contract and the Acts and the Regulations relative to Nondiscrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin.   (4) Information and Reports:  The contractor will provide all information and reports required by the Acts, the Regulations, and directives issued pursuant thereto and will permit access to its books, records, accounts, other sources of information, and its facilities as may be determined by TxDOT or the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to be pertinent and to ascertain compliance with such Acts, Regulations, and instructions.  Where any information required of a contractor is in the exclusive possession of another who fails or refuses to furnish this information, the contractor will so certify to TxDOT or the FHWA, as appropriate, and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information. (5) Sanctions for Noncompliance:  In the event of a contractor’s noncompliance with the nondiscrimination provisions of this contract, TxDOT will impose such contract sanctions as it or the FHWA may determine to be appropriate, including, but not limited to: a) withholding payments to the contractor under the contract until the contractor complies; and/or b) cancelling, terminating, or suspending a contract, in whole or in part. (6) Incorporation of Provisions:  The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (6) in every subcontract, including procurements of materials and leases of \f",
      "Revised August 2018*   21 – 25  equipment, unless exempt by the Acts, the Regulations and directives issued pursuant thereto.  The contractor will take action with respect to any subcontract or procurement as TxDOT or the FHWA may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for non-compliance. Provided, that if the contractor becomes involved in litigation with, or is threatened with litigation by, a subcontractor or supplier because of such direction, the contractor may request TxDOT to enter into any litigation to protect the interests of TxDOT.  In addition, the contractor may request the United States to enter into the litigation to protect the interests of the United States. (d) The contractor agrees to comply with the provisions of Appendix A attached hereto, which is incorporated by reference and made a part hereof. 6.11  E-VERIFY:  Pursuant to Executive Order RP-80, Vendor certifies and ensures that for all contracts for services, Vendor shall, to the extent permitted by law, utilize the United States Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify system during the term of this agreement to determine the eligibility of: (a) All persons employed by Vendor during the term of this agreement to perform duties within the State of Texas; and (b) All persons, including subcontractors, assigned by Vendor to perform work pursuant to this agreement. Violation of this provision constitutes a material breach of this agreement. PART 7.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION 7.01  DISPUTE RESOLUTION:  In accordance with Government Code, Chapter 2260, TxDOT has established a dispute resolution process in 43 Texas Administrative Code §§9.1 and 9.2 to resolve disputes that may arise between TxDOT and the vendor under the purchase order in 43 Texas Administrative Code §§9.1 and 9.2 (the dispute resolution process described by Government Code Chapter 2260 and 43 TAC §§9.1 and 9.2 referred to herein as the “dispute resolution process”).  The dispute resolution process shall be used by TxDOT and the vendor to resolve disputes arising under the purchase order, including without limitation any claim for breach of contract.  The contested case process provided in Chapter 2260 is the vendor’s sole and exclusive process for seeking a remedy for an alleged breach of contract by TxDOT if the parties are unable to resolve their disputes as described above.  Compliance with the contested case process provided in Chapter 2260 is a condition precedent to seeking consent to sue from the Legislature under Chapter 107, Civil Practices and Remedies Code.  Neither the execution of the contract by TxDOT nor any other conduct of any representative of TxDOT relating to the contract shall be considered a waiver of sovereign immunity to suit.  Notwithstanding any provision of the purchase order to the contrary, unless otherwise agreed in writing by TxDOT, the vendor shall continue performance and shall not be excused from performance during the period of contract claim or dispute is pending; however, the vendor may suspend performance during the pendency of such claim or dispute if the vendor has complied with all provisions of Section 2251.051, Texas Government Code, and such suspension of performance is expressly applicable and authorized under that law. PART 8.  CONTRACT TERMS 8.01  TERM OF CONTRACT:  The term of the contract shall be as stated on the purchase order. 8.02  ORDER OF PRECEDENCE:  In the event of conflicts or inconsistencies between this contract and its exhibits or attachments, such conflicts or inconsistencies shall be resolved by reference to the documents in the order specified on the purchase order. 8.03  TERMINATION OF A PURCHASE ORDER (a) FOR CAUSE: If vendor fails to provide a good or service according to the provisions of the purchase order or fails to comply with any term or condition of the purchase order, or if any representation or certification made in the purchase order or any related document is false, incomplete or inaccurate, TxDOT may immediately terminate the purchase order upon written notice to the vendor.  TxDOT may, at its option, re-solicit or award the purchase order to the next lowest responsive and responsible respondent.  The defaulting vendor will not be considered in the re-solicitation and may not be considered in future solicitations for the same type of work \f",
      "Revised August 2018*   22 – 25  unless the specification or scope of work is significantly changed.  If vendor defaults on the purchase order, TxDOT may purchase the goods or service elsewhere and charge any increase in cost to the defaulting vendor.  TxDOT may impose sanctions, debar or suspend the vendor for abandonment or default(s) on the purchase order.  Termination is not an exclusive remedy, but will be in addition to any other remedies TxDOT may have by law, in equity, or under the contract.  TxDOT may exercise any other right, remedy or privilege which may be available to it under applicable law or may proceed by appropriate court action to enforce the provisions of the contract.  The exercise of any of the foregoing remedies will not constitute a termination of the contract unless TxDOT notifies the vendor in writing prior to the exercise of such remedy.  The vendor shall be responsible for all costs and expenses, including court costs, incurred by TxDOT with respect to the enforcement of any of the remedies listed herein. (b) FOR CONVENIENCE:  The purchase order may be terminated in whole or in part, without penalty, by either party by providing thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.  In the event of such termination, the vendor shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing, cease all work immediately upon the effective date of termination.  TxDOT will be liable only for payments for goods or services ordered before the termination date.  With regard to services, TxDOT will pay the vendor the purchase order price prorated for acceptable service performed up to the date specified in the notice of termination.  Termination under this paragraph shall not relieve the vendor of any obligation or liability that has occurred prior to termination.  The vendor shall refund any balance of unused prepaid funds. 8.04  SALE OR ASSIGNMENT:  The purchase order is void if sold or assigned to another company without written approval from TxDOT.  Written notification of changes to company name, address, telephone number, etc. shall be provided to TxDOT as soon as possible but not later than thirty (30) days from the date of change. 8.05  RENEWAL OF BLANKET PURCHASE ORDER FOR GOODS:  A blanket purchase order for goods may be renewed for up to three additional like periods of time at the original price, terms and conditions, and any approved changes.  Any changes will be clearly detailed in the amended purchase order. 8.06  RENEWAL OF PURCHASE ORDER FOR SERVICES:  The purchase order may be renewed for up to three additional like periods of time at the same terms and conditions, or as otherwise stated in the solicitation, provided both parties agree in writing to do so prior to the expiration of the purchase order. 8.07  RENEWAL OF PURCHASE ORDER FOR NEGOTIATED GOODS OR SERVICES (a) The purchase order may be renewed for up to three additional like periods of time at the same terms and conditions, or as otherwise stated in the solicitation, provided both parties agree in writing to do so prior to the expiration of the purchase order. (b) For purchase orders issued using the RFP or RFO method of purchase, TxDOT reserves the right to negotiate additional time if circumstances require.  TxDOT and the vendor may negotiate additional time and price based on the deliverable or need in the best interest of the state and TxDOT. 8.08  EXTENSION OF PURCHASE ORDERS (a) TxDOT reserves the right to extend a purchase order for time only past the stated term to allow the vendor to complete the requirements or to accommodate unanticipated events or requirements prior to the expiration of the purchase order. (b) A purchase order in its final renewal period may be further extended for time and money for a period up to ninety (90) days at the option of TxDOT. (c) The vendor may request a time only extension of a purchase order by submitting written justification to TxDOT.  TxDOT will approve or decline the request for extension in writing.  An extension will only be effective if it is issued by the TxDOT purchasing department in the form of a purchase order change notice.  \f",
      "Revised August 2018*   23 – 25  8.09  SEVERABILITY CLAUSE:  In the event that any provision(s) of this purchase order may later be determined to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, then the remaining provisions of this purchase order shall remain in full force and effect. 8.10  BINDING EFFECT AND SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS  (a) By executing this purchase order, the vendor binds itself, its respective successors and assignees, to the faithful performance of the terms and conditions and provisions of the purchase order. (b) Expiration or termination of the purchase order for any reason shall not release vendor from any liabilities or obligations set forth in the terms and conditions and purchase order or any work order that are expressly stated to survive any such expiration or termination or which by their nature are intended to be applicable following such expiration or termination, including any and all provisions regarding confidentiality, indemnification, transition, records, audit, property rights, dispute resolution, invoice and fees verification.  Upon expiration or termination of the purchase order for any reason, TxDOT shall retain ownership of all associated work products and documentation obtained from or created by the vendor under the purchase order. Vendor shall deliver all documents or other work product to TxDOT upon request, including original versions if so specified in the request. (c) The term of service stated on the purchase order is binding on the vendor regardless of the term on the originating agency contract or its purchase order.   \f",

SUBMIT PROPOSAL TO:  City of La Mirada Attn: City Clerk’s Office 13700 La Mirada Blvd. La Mirada, CA 90638 (562) 943 – 0131    \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  2   I. REQUEST SUMMARY  The City of La Mirada is seeking proposals from firms to provide investment advisory and portfolio management services for approximately $75 million in operating and capital funds (non-pension).  The term will be three years, with two one year options, which may be exercised at the City’s discretion.  The selected firm(s) will be responsible for performing in accordance with the scope of services, as further detailed in Section III.  II. INTRODUCTION A. Community Profile  The City was incorporated in 1960 and is a general law city with a population of approximately 49,000. The City Council is comprised of five elected citizens, with the City Manager as the administrative and executive head of the City. The City employs 73 full-time employees and approximately 300 part-time employees.  The City of La Mirada provides public safety services, public works, parks and community services, planning, building and safety, and code enforcement. The City’s award winning Theatre for the Performing Arts and Splash! La Mirada Regional Aquatics Center provide exceptional cultural and recreational opportunities for residents and guests. The City contracts with Los Angeles County for law enforcement, animal control and building services.  The total adopted budget for Fiscal Year 2018-19 is approximately $72 million, excluding transfers, of which $35.6 million are General Fund expenditures.    B. Background  The City’s primary investment objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on public funds while minimizing the potential for capital losses arising from market changes or issuer default. Although the generation of revenues through interest earnings on investments is an appropriate City goal, the primary consideration in the investment of City funds is capital preservation in the overall portfolio. As such, the City’s yield objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on City investments rather than the maximum generation of income, which could expose the City to unacceptable levels of risk.  While the City has utilized a vendor for this service since 2008, this RFP is being issued in compliance with internal requirements to periodically solicit proposals.   C. General RFP Submittal Information  The City’s designated staff will evaluate proposals received. During the review process, the City reserves the right, where it may serve the City’s best interest, to request additional information or clarification from those that submit proposals, or \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  3   allow clarifications, corrections of errors, or omissions. Any and all changes in the RFP will be made by written addendum, which shall be issued by the City to all prospective proposers who have registered for the RFP via the City’s website.  The City reserves the right to retain all proposals submitted. Submission of a proposal indicates the proposer’s acceptance of the conditions contained in this RFP, unless clearly and specifically noted in the proposal submitted and confirmed in the contract between the City and the proposer selected.  The preparation of the proposal will be at the total expense of the proposer. There is no expressed or implied obligation for the City to reimburse responding proposers for any expense incurred in the preparation of proposals in response to this request. All proposals submitted to the City shall become properties of the City and will not be returned. If any information in a proposal is confidential and/or proprietary, please further submit a separate, redacted copy for servicing public records requests.  The proposer may submit an alternative proposal (or proposals) that it believes will also meet the City\\'s project objectives; but in a different way. In this case, the proposer must provide an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the alternatives, and discuss under what circumstances the City would prefer one alternative to the other(s). If an alternative proposal is submitted, the maximum length of the proposal may be expanded proportionately by the number of alternatives submitted.  The City reserves the right to reject any or all proposals, in whole or part, to waive any informality in any proposal, and to accept the proposal which, in its discretion, is in the best interest of the City. Any proposer may withdraw his/her proposal, without obligation, at any time prior to the scheduled closing time for receipt of proposals. A withdrawal will not be effective unless made personally, telephonic, or electronic notification received prior to the closing date. Proposals may later be referred to the City Council for appropriate action.  All proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. on Monday, February 25, 2019 at which time they will be opened at the City Clerk’s Office. Late submissions will not be accepted. To be considered, proposers must send four (4) hard copies of their proposal in a sealed envelope with the name of the company submitting the proposal and the title of “Investment Advisory and Portfolio Management Services” to:  City of La Mirada City Clerk 13700 La Mirada Blvd. La Mirada, CA 90638   \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  4   For a complete list of the City’s RFP submittal terms and conditions, legal statements, and insurance requirements, please refer to the exhibits attached hereto.

The response will not be considered for award but will be retained by TxDOT according to the response information confidentiality provision referenced in Section 2.05 (c). 2.07  DETERMINING AWARD:  A response to a solicitation is an offer to contract with TxDOT based upon the terms, conditions and specifications contained in the solicitation.  Responses do not become contracts unless and until they are accepted through an authorized TxDOT designee by issuance of a purchase order.  In determining the best value for the state, the purchase price and whether the goods or services meet specifications are the most important considerations, unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. (a) BEST VALUE CRITERIA FOR PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES:  When specified in the solicitation, the factors listed in Government Code Section 2155.074 will be considered in making a best value award.  This section allows TxDOT to apply best value criteria in order to obtain goods and services that provide the best value for TxDOT.  Under these guidelines, a respondent is not automatically awarded a purchase order if they submit the lowest bid response.  TxDOT will be the sole judge as to which response is the most advantageous and in the best interest of TxDOT.  In determining best value, factors other than price may be considered in making an award.  Those factors are: (1) life cycle costs; (2) the quality and reliability of goods and services; (3) the delivery terms; \\x0cRevised August 2018*   5 – 25  (4) indicators of probable vendor performance; (5) cost of employee training associated with a purchase; (6) the effect of a purchase on agency productivity; and (7) other factors relevant to determining best value for the state in the context of a particular purchase. (b) BEST VALUE CRITERIA FOR RFO PURCHASES:  Best value criteria will be used on all information technology equipment or service purchases.  Those best value criteria include but are not limited to: (1) compatibility to facilitate exchange of existing data; (2) capacity for expansion and upgrading to more advanced levels of technology; (3) quantitative reliability factors; (4) level of training required to bring end-users to a stated level of proficiency; (5) technical support requirements for maintenance of data across a network platform and management of the networks hardware and software; (6) items, features, etc., which are in addition to requirements listed, as well as factors which, in TxDOT’s opinion, add value to the product or service but are not specifically required within the solicitation. (c) NEGOTIATIONS FOR RFO AND RFP PURCHASES:  TxDOT reserves the right to conduct formal negotiations with respondent(s) judged to have the best offer pertaining to price, goods, services and terms. (d) TxDOT reserves the right to reject a response from a respondent whose goods or services to TxDOT or other state agencies have been documented as unsatisfactory in providing the same goods or service. (e) TIE RESPONSES:  In case of tie responses, one or more preferences described in Government Code Chapter 2155 and 34 TAC §20.306 will be used to make an award.  Tie responses which cannot be resolved by application of one or more preferences shall be made by drawing lots. 2.08  PREFERENCES:  A respondent may claim a preference under 34 TAC §20.306.  To claim a preference, a respondent shall identify the preference on the solicitation or on the response to the solicitation.  If the appropriate area on the solicitation or response is not marked, a preference will not be granted unless other documents included in the response show a right to the preference. 2.09  DELIVERY:  No substitutions or cancellations will be permitted without written approval from TxDOT, which approval must be issued in the form of a purchase order change notice issued by TxDOT’s purchasing department. (a) If delay is foreseen, vendor shall give written notice to TxDOT.  TxDOT has the right to extend delivery or service date if reasons appear valid.  Vendor shall keep TxDOT advised at all times of the status of the order. Default in promised delivery or service date (unless vendor has received a written extension of the delivery or service date which has been signed by TxDOT), or failure to meet specifications, authorizes  TxDOT to purchase goods or services elsewhere and charge the full increase, if any, in cost and handling to defaulting vendor. (b) Delivery shall be made between 8 AM and 4 PM Monday through Friday except on regularly observed state or federal holidays, unless prior approval has been obtained from TxDOT or otherwise stated in the solicitation. (c) Receipt of goods or services does not constitute acceptance. (d) Goods and materials shall be properly packaged.  Damaged goods and materials will not be accepted.  If the damage is not readily apparent at the time of delivery, the goods shall be returned to the vendor at no cost to TxDOT.  TxDOT reserves the right to inspect goods at a \\x0cRevised August 2018*   6 – 25  reasonable time subsequent to delivery where circumstances or conditions prevent effective inspection of the goods at the time of delivery. 2.10  INSPECTIONS AND TESTS:  Goods will be subject to inspection and test by TxDOT to the extent practicable at all times and places.  Tests will be performed on samples taken from regular shipment.  In the event samples tested fail to meet all conditions and requirements of the specification, the cost of the sample used and the cost of the testing shall be borne by the vendor.  Goods which have been delivered and rejected in whole or in part may, at TxDOT’s option, be returned to the vendor or held for disposition at vendor’s risk and expense.  Latent defects may result in revocation of acceptance.   Acceptance of services shall be based on attainment of performance in accord with specifications and the purchase order. 2.11  VENDOR PERFORMANCE:  State agencies shall report a vendor\\'s performance on any purchase of $25,000 or more from contracts administered by the commission or any other purchase made through an agency\\'s delegated authority or a purchase made pursuant to the authority in Government Code, Title 10, Subtitle D or a purchase exempt from CPA/SPD procurement rules and procedures.  Past Performance:  A Respondent\\'s past performance will be measured based upon pass/fail criteria, in compliance with applicable provisions of §2155.074, 2155.075, 2156.007, 2157.003, and 2157.125, Government Code. Respondents may fail this selection criterion for any of the following conditions:  • A letter grade score below ‘C’ in the Vendor Performance System, or a score of “legacy unsatisfactory” for historic reports submitted prior to the implementation of the current rating system,  • Being currently under a Corrective Action Plan through the CPA, • Having repeated negative Vendor Performance Reports for the same reason, • Having purchase orders that have been cancelled or terminated in the previous 12 months for non-performance (i.e. late delivery, etc.).  Vendor performance information is located on the CPA website at: http://www.txsmartbuy.com/vpts  TxDOT may conduct reference checks with other entities regarding past performance. In addition to evaluating performance through the Vendor Performance Tracking System (as authorized by 34 Texas Administrative Code §20.108) TxDOT may examine other sources of vendor performance including, but not limited to, notices of termination, cure notices, assessments of liquidated damages, litigation, audit reports, and non-renewals of contracts.  Any such investigations shall be at the sole discretion of TxDOT, and any negative findings, as determined by TxDOT, may result in non-award to the Respondent. PART 3.

The defaulting vendor will not be considered in the re-solicitation and may not be considered in future solicitations for the same type of work \\x0cRevised August 2018*   22 – 25  unless the specification or scope of work is significantly changed.  If vendor defaults on the purchase order, TxDOT may purchase the goods or service elsewhere and charge any increase in cost to the defaulting vendor.  TxDOT may impose sanctions, debar or suspend the vendor for abandonment or default(s) on the purchase order.  Termination is not an exclusive remedy, but will be in addition to any other remedies TxDOT may have by law, in equity, or under the contract.  TxDOT may exercise any other right, remedy or privilege which may be available to it under applicable law or may proceed by appropriate court action to enforce the provisions of the contract.  The exercise of any of the foregoing remedies will not constitute a termination of the contract unless TxDOT notifies the vendor in writing prior to the exercise of such remedy.

SUBMIT PROPOSAL TO:  City of La Mirada Attn: City Clerk’s Office 13700 La Mirada Blvd. La Mirada, CA 90638 (562) 943 – 0131    \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  2   I. REQUEST SUMMARY  The City of La Mirada is seeking proposals from firms to provide investment advisory and portfolio management services for approximately $75 million in operating and capital funds (non-pension).  The term will be three years, with two one year options, which may be exercised at the City’s discretion.  The selected firm(s) will be responsible for performing in accordance with the scope of services, as further detailed in Section III.  II. INTRODUCTION A. Community Profile  The City was incorporated in 1960 and is a general law city with a population of approximately 49,000. The City Council is comprised of five elected citizens, with the City Manager as the administrative and executive head of the City. The City employs 73 full-time employees and approximately 300 part-time employees.  The City of La Mirada provides public safety services, public works, parks and community services, planning, building and safety, and code enforcement. The City’s award winning Theatre for the Performing Arts and Splash! La Mirada Regional Aquatics Center provide exceptional cultural and recreational opportunities for residents and guests. The City contracts with Los Angeles County for law enforcement, animal control and building services.  The total adopted budget for Fiscal Year 2018-19 is approximately $72 million, excluding transfers, of which $35.6 million are General Fund expenditures.    B. Background  The City’s primary investment objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on public funds while minimizing the potential for capital losses arising from market changes or issuer default. Although the generation of revenues through interest earnings on investments is an appropriate City goal, the primary consideration in the investment of City funds is capital preservation in the overall portfolio. As such, the City’s yield objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on City investments rather than the maximum generation of income, which could expose the City to unacceptable levels of risk.  While the City has utilized a vendor for this service since 2008, this RFP is being issued in compliance with internal requirements to periodically solicit proposals.   C. General RFP Submittal Information  The City’s designated staff will evaluate proposals received. During the review process, the City reserves the right, where it may serve the City’s best interest, to request additional information or clarification from those that submit proposals, or \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  3   allow clarifications, corrections of errors, or omissions. Any and all changes in the RFP will be made by written addendum, which shall be issued by the City to all prospective proposers who have registered for the RFP via the City’s website.  The City reserves the right to retain all proposals submitted. Submission of a proposal indicates the proposer’s acceptance of the conditions contained in this RFP, unless clearly and specifically noted in the proposal submitted and confirmed in the contract between the City and the proposer selected.  The preparation of the proposal will be at the total expense of the proposer. There is no expressed or implied obligation for the City to reimburse responding proposers for any expense incurred in the preparation of proposals in response to this request. All proposals submitted to the City shall become properties of the City and will not be returned. If any information in a proposal is confidential and/or proprietary, please further submit a separate, redacted copy for servicing public records requests.  The proposer may submit an alternative proposal (or proposals) that it believes will also meet the City\\'s project objectives; but in a different way. In this case, the proposer must provide an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the alternatives, and discuss under what circumstances the City would prefer one alternative to the other(s). If an alternative proposal is submitted, the maximum length of the proposal may be expanded proportionately by the number of alternatives submitted.  The City reserves the right to reject any or all proposals, in whole or part, to waive any informality in any proposal, and to accept the proposal which, in its discretion, is in the best interest of the City. Any proposer may withdraw his/her proposal, without obligation, at any time prior to the scheduled closing time for receipt of proposals. A withdrawal will not be effective unless made personally, telephonic, or electronic notification received prior to the closing date. Proposals may later be referred to the City Council for appropriate action.  All proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. on Monday, February 25, 2019 at which time they will be opened at the City Clerk’s Office. Late submissions will not be accepted. To be considered, proposers must send four (4) hard copies of their proposal in a sealed envelope with the name of the company submitting the proposal and the title of “Investment Advisory and Portfolio Management Services” to:  City of La Mirada City Clerk 13700 La Mirada Blvd. La Mirada, CA 90638   \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  4   For a complete list of the City’s RFP submittal terms and conditions, legal statements, and insurance requirements, please refer to the exhibits attached hereto.

SUBMIT PROPOSAL TO:  City of La Mirada Attn: City Clerk’s Office 13700 La Mirada Blvd. La Mirada, CA 90638 (562) 943 – 0131    \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  2   I. REQUEST SUMMARY  The City of La Mirada is seeking proposals from firms to provide investment advisory and portfolio management services for approximately $75 million in operating and capital funds (non-pension).  The term will be three years, with two one year options, which may be exercised at the City’s discretion.  The selected firm(s) will be responsible for performing in accordance with the scope of services, as further detailed in Section III.  II. INTRODUCTION A. Community Profile  The City was incorporated in 1960 and is a general law city with a population of approximately 49,000. The City Council is comprised of five elected citizens, with the City Manager as the administrative and executive head of the City. The City employs 73 full-time employees and approximately 300 part-time employees.  The City of La Mirada provides public safety services, public works, parks and community services, planning, building and safety, and code enforcement. The City’s award winning Theatre for the Performing Arts and Splash! La Mirada Regional Aquatics Center provide exceptional cultural and recreational opportunities for residents and guests. The City contracts with Los Angeles County for law enforcement, animal control and building services.  The total adopted budget for Fiscal Year 2018-19 is approximately $72 million, excluding transfers, of which $35.6 million are General Fund expenditures.    B. Background  The City’s primary investment objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on public funds while minimizing the potential for capital losses arising from market changes or issuer default. Although the generation of revenues through interest earnings on investments is an appropriate City goal, the primary consideration in the investment of City funds is capital preservation in the overall portfolio. As such, the City’s yield objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on City investments rather than the maximum generation of income, which could expose the City to unacceptable levels of risk.  While the City has utilized a vendor for this service since 2008, this RFP is being issued in compliance with internal requirements to periodically solicit proposals.   C. General RFP Submittal Information  The City’s designated staff will evaluate proposals received. During the review process, the City reserves the right, where it may serve the City’s best interest, to request additional information or clarification from those that submit proposals, or \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  3   allow clarifications, corrections of errors, or omissions. Any and all changes in the RFP will be made by written addendum, which shall be issued by the City to all prospective proposers who have registered for the RFP via the City’s website.  The City reserves the right to retain all proposals submitted. Submission of a proposal indicates the proposer’s acceptance of the conditions contained in this RFP, unless clearly and specifically noted in the proposal submitted and confirmed in the contract between the City and the proposer selected.  The preparation of the proposal will be at the total expense of the proposer. There is no expressed or implied obligation for the City to reimburse responding proposers for any expense incurred in the preparation of proposals in response to this request. All proposals submitted to the City shall become properties of the City and will not be returned. If any information in a proposal is confidential and/or proprietary, please further submit a separate, redacted copy for servicing public records requests.  The proposer may submit an alternative proposal (or proposals) that it believes will also meet the City\\'s project objectives; but in a different way. In this case, the proposer must provide an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the alternatives, and discuss under what circumstances the City would prefer one alternative to the other(s). If an alternative proposal is submitted, the maximum length of the proposal may be expanded proportionately by the number of alternatives submitted.  The City reserves the right to reject any or all proposals, in whole or part, to waive any informality in any proposal, and to accept the proposal which, in its discretion, is in the best interest of the City. Any proposer may withdraw his/her proposal, without obligation, at any time prior to the scheduled closing time for receipt of proposals. A withdrawal will not be effective unless made personally, telephonic, or electronic notification received prior to the closing date. Proposals may later be referred to the City Council for appropriate action.  All proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. on Monday, February 25, 2019 at which time they will be opened at the City Clerk’s Office. Late submissions will not be accepted. To be considered, proposers must send four (4) hard copies of their proposal in a sealed envelope with the name of the company submitting the proposal and the title of “Investment Advisory and Portfolio Management Services” to:  City of La Mirada City Clerk 13700 La Mirada Blvd. La Mirada, CA 90638   \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  4   For a complete list of the City’s RFP submittal terms and conditions, legal statements, and insurance requirements, please refer to the exhibits attached hereto.

The term “response” or “bid” shall mean the proposal, quote, bid, or offer made to TxDOT in response to a solicitation.   The term “respondent” or “bidder” shall mean any party who makes a response to a solicitation, including the vendor. The term “vendor” or “contractor” shall mean the party listed as vendor on the purchase order. 1.02  STATUTORY AUTHORITY:  This procurement falls under the statutory authority of Government Code Chapter 2151 (commonly known as the “Purchasing Act”), Chapter 2155 (Purchasing:  General Rules and Procedures), Chapter 2157 (Purchasing Methods) and Chapter 2161 (Historically Underutilized Businesses, “HUBs”).  The purchasing procedures include statutory requirements and those requirements established by rule of the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts (CPA), Statewide Procurement Division (SPD) as contained in 34 TAC §20.31 and other applicable Federal and State statues and rules herein cited. 1.03  TITLE VI ASSURANCE:  TxDOT, in accordance with the provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (78 Stat. 252, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d to 2000d-4) and 49 C.F.R. Part 21 and 28 CFR Section 50.3 (for purposes of this Section and Section 6.10 only, the “Acts” and the “Regulations,” respectively), hereby notifies all bidders that it will affirmatively ensure that in any contract entered into pursuant to this advertisement,  disadvantaged business enterprises will be afforded full and fair opportunity to submit bids in response to this invitation  and will not be discriminated against on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, in consideration for an award.

(g) E-mailed responses may be accepted if stated on the solicitation.  E-mailed responses must be in Portable Document Format (pdf), signed by the respondent and attached to the e-mail to be considered for award. (h) RESPONDENT EXCEPTIONS OR CONDITIONED RESPONSES:  Exceptions taken by the respondent to TxDOT’s Terms and Conditions or respondent’s Terms and Conditions attached to a response will not be considered unless specifically referred to and clearly identified as such within the response.  TxDOT may reject a response that takes exception to TxDOT’s Terms and Conditions. (i) TxDOT reserves the right to accept or reject all or any part of any response, waive minor technicalities and make an award to best serve the interests of the State.  TxDOT reserves the right to reject any response not prepared and submitted in accordance with the solicitation requirements. (j) Response should indicate number of days required to deliver goods, or begin service (if required), at TxDOT’s designated location.  Failure to indicate delivery time obligates vendor to complete delivery in fourteen (14) calendar days. (k) Samples, when requested must be furnished at no cost to TxDOT.  TxDOT may perform tests on samples. If not destroyed in testing, samples will be returned upon request at respondent’s expense.  Each sample shall be marked with respondent’s name and address, and TxDOT solicitation number.  Samples shall not be enclosed or attached to a response unless specified in the solicitation. 2.03  PRICING (a) TxDOT’s automated purchasing system requires pricing to be submitted per unit, multiplied by the quantity and extended.  Unit prices shall govern in the event of extension errors.  If a trade discount is offered on the solicitation response, it should be deducted and net line extensions should be shown. (b) All prices shall be firm for thirty (30) days from the solicitation response date unless otherwise stated in the solicitation.  “Discount from list” pricing is not acceptable unless requested.  Cash discounts are acceptable, but are not considered in making an award. (c) All purchases are on a firm, fixed price basis unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. (d) Price(s) shall not increase during the term of the purchase order unless otherwise stated in the solicitation.  Vendor shall give price reductions to TxDOT that result from reduced cost to the vendor during the term of the purchase order. (e) All prices shall be F.O.B. destination, freight prepaid and allowed.  This means the vendor shall prepay and include the freight charges in the unit price.

State Sales tax and Federal Excise Tax Exemption Certificates will be furnished by TxDOT on request. (g) The purchase order may contain a “Total Cost Not to Exceed” statement.  Vendor shall not perform any work that may exceed either the purchase order total or the not-to-exceed total without prior written authorization from TxDOT. \\x0cRevised August 2018*   4 – 25  (h) Consistent and continued tie response pricing may lead to rejection of the response by TxDOT and investigation for antitrust violations. 2.04  ADA CONSIDERATIONS AND NOTIFICATION:  Persons with special needs or disabilities who plan to attend any pre-response conference or bid opening and who require auxiliary aids or service should contact the purchaser noted on the solicitation as the point of contact a minimum of three (3) days prior to the meeting so arrangements can be made. 2.05  RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS AND BID OPENINGS (a) NEGOTIATED SOLICITATIONS:  At the time of opening or closing for RFOs or RFPs, only the names of respondents will be announced.

(c) DISCLOSURE OF RESPONSE:  Information submitted in an accepted response will not be returned to the respondent.  The Public Information Act (PIA), Government Code Chapter 552, allows the public to have access to information in the possession of a governmental body through an open records request.  Therefore, the respondent shall clearly identify in the response any confidential or proprietary information.  Proprietary information identified by the respondent in the response, will be kept confidential by TxDOT to the extent permitted by state law.  TxDOT merely raises the exception on behalf of the vendor.  TxDOT takes no legal position on disclosure.  TxDOT will use best efforts to give the respondent or the awarded vendor an opportunity to present to the Office of the Attorney General its arguments for non-disclosure of its identified confidential or proprietary information. 2.06  ALTERATIONS OR WITHDRAWAL OF RESPONSES (a) Any alterations to a response made before the opening or closing date and time shall be initialed by respondent or authorized agent.  Response cannot be altered or amended after the opening or closing date and time. (b) A response may be withdrawn if requested in writing prior to the opening or closing date and time.  A response may be withdrawn from consideration after the opening or closing date only with the approval of TxDOT based on respondent’s written, acceptable reason.  The response will not be considered for award but will be retained by TxDOT according to the response information confidentiality provision referenced in Section 2.05 (c). 2.07  DETERMINING AWARD:  A response to a solicitation is an offer to contract with TxDOT based upon the terms, conditions and specifications contained in the solicitation.  Responses do not become contracts unless and until they are accepted through an authorized TxDOT designee by issuance of a purchase order.  In determining the best value for the state, the purchase price and whether the goods or services meet specifications are the most important considerations, unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. (a) BEST VALUE CRITERIA FOR PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES:  When specified in the solicitation, the factors listed in Government Code Section 2155.074 will be considered in making a best value award.  This section allows TxDOT to apply best value criteria in order to obtain goods and services that provide the best value for TxDOT.  Under these guidelines, a respondent is not automatically awarded a purchase order if they submit the lowest bid response.  TxDOT will be the sole judge as to which response is the most advantageous and in the best interest of TxDOT.  In determining best value, factors other than price may be considered in making an award.  Those factors are: (1) life cycle costs; (2) the quality and reliability of goods and services; (3) the delivery terms; \\x0cRevised August 2018*   5 – 25  (4) indicators of probable vendor performance; (5) cost of employee training associated with a purchase; (6) the effect of a purchase on agency productivity; and (7) other factors relevant to determining best value for the state in the context of a particular purchase. (b) BEST VALUE CRITERIA FOR RFO PURCHASES:  Best value criteria will be used on all information technology equipment or service purchases.  Those best value criteria include but are not limited to: (1) compatibility to facilitate exchange of existing data; (2) capacity for expansion and upgrading to more advanced levels of technology; (3) quantitative reliability factors; (4) level of training required to bring end-users to a stated level of proficiency; (5) technical support requirements for maintenance of data across a network platform and management of the networks hardware and software; (6) items, features, etc., which are in addition to requirements listed, as well as factors which, in TxDOT’s opinion, add value to the product or service but are not specifically required within the solicitation. (c) NEGOTIATIONS FOR RFO AND RFP PURCHASES:  TxDOT reserves the right to conduct formal negotiations with respondent(s) judged to have the best offer pertaining to price, goods, services and terms. (d) TxDOT reserves the right to reject a response from a respondent whose goods or services to TxDOT or other state agencies have been documented as unsatisfactory in providing the same goods or service. (e) TIE RESPONSES:  In case of tie responses, one or more preferences described in Government Code Chapter 2155 and 34 TAC §20.306 will be used to make an award.  Tie responses which cannot be resolved by application of one or more preferences shall be made by drawing lots. 2.08  PREFERENCES:  A respondent may claim a preference under 34 TAC §20.306.  To claim a preference, a respondent shall identify the preference on the solicitation or on the response to the solicitation.  If the appropriate area on the solicitation or response is not marked, a preference will not be granted unless other documents included in the response show a right to the preference. 2.09  DELIVERY:  No substitutions or cancellations will be permitted without written approval from TxDOT, which approval must be issued in the form of a purchase order change notice issued by TxDOT’s purchasing department. (a) If delay is foreseen, vendor shall give written notice to TxDOT.  TxDOT has the right to extend delivery or service date if reasons appear valid.  Vendor shall keep TxDOT advised at all times of the status of the order. Default in promised delivery or service date (unless vendor has received a written extension of the delivery or service date which has been signed by TxDOT), or failure to meet specifications, authorizes  TxDOT to purchase goods or services elsewhere and charge the full increase, if any, in cost and handling to defaulting vendor. (b) Delivery shall be made between 8 AM and 4 PM Monday through Friday except on regularly observed state or federal holidays, unless prior approval has been obtained from TxDOT or otherwise stated in the solicitation. (c) Receipt of goods or services does not constitute acceptance. (d) Goods and materials shall be properly packaged.  Damaged goods and materials will not be accepted.  If the damage is not readily apparent at the time of delivery, the goods shall be returned to the vendor at no cost to TxDOT.  TxDOT reserves the right to inspect goods at a \\x0cRevised August 2018*   6 – 25  reasonable time subsequent to delivery where circumstances or conditions prevent effective inspection of the goods at the time of delivery. 2.10  INSPECTIONS AND TESTS:  Goods will be subject to inspection and test by TxDOT to the extent practicable at all times and places.  Tests will be performed on samples taken from regular shipment.  In the event samples tested fail to meet all conditions and requirements of the specification, the cost of the sample used and the cost of the testing shall be borne by the vendor.  Goods which have been delivered and rejected in whole or in part may, at TxDOT’s option, be returned to the vendor or held for disposition at vendor’s risk and expense.  Latent defects may result in revocation of acceptance.   Acceptance of services shall be based on attainment of performance in accord with specifications and the purchase order. 2.11  VENDOR PERFORMANCE:  State agencies shall report a vendor\\'s performance on any purchase of $25,000 or more from contracts administered by the commission or any other purchase made through an agency\\'s delegated authority or a purchase made pursuant to the authority in Government Code, Title 10, Subtitle D or a purchase exempt from CPA/SPD procurement rules and procedures.  Past Performance:  A Respondent\\'s past performance will be measured based upon pass/fail criteria, in compliance with applicable provisions of §2155.074, 2155.075, 2156.007, 2157.003, and 2157.125, Government Code. Respondents may fail this selection criterion for any of the following conditions:  • A letter grade score below ‘C’ in the Vendor Performance System, or a score of “legacy unsatisfactory” for historic reports submitted prior to the implementation of the current rating system,  • Being currently under a Corrective Action Plan through the CPA, • Having repeated negative Vendor Performance Reports for the same reason, • Having purchase orders that have been cancelled or terminated in the previous 12 months for non-performance (i.e. late delivery, etc.).  Vendor performance information is located on the CPA website at: http://www.txsmartbuy.com/vpts  TxDOT may conduct reference checks with other entities regarding past performance. In addition to evaluating performance through the Vendor Performance Tracking System (as authorized by 34 Texas Administrative Code §20.108) TxDOT may examine other sources of vendor performance including, but not limited to, notices of termination, cure notices, assessments of liquidated damages, litigation, audit reports, and non-renewals of contracts.  Any such investigations shall be at the sole discretion of TxDOT, and any negative findings, as determined by TxDOT, may result in non-award to the Respondent. PART 3.  RESPONDENT AFFIRMATIONS 3.01  FALSE STATEMENTS:  Respondent represents and warrants that all statements and information prepared and submitted in response to the solicitation are current, complete, true and accurate.  Signing the response to the solicitation with a false statement is a material breach of contract and shall void the submitted response or any resulting contracts, and may result in removal of the respondent from the Centralized Master Bidders List. 3.02  CONFORMANCE:  The respondent warrants to TxDOT that all goods and services furnished shall conform in all respects to the terms of this purchase order, including any drawings, specifications or standards incorporated herein, and any defects in materials, workmanship, and free from such defects in design.

(4) Information and Reports:  The contractor will provide all information and reports required by the Acts, the Regulations, and directives issued pursuant thereto and will permit access to its books, records, accounts, other sources of information, and its facilities as may be determined by TxDOT or the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to be pertinent and to ascertain compliance with such Acts, Regulations, and instructions.  Where any information required of a contractor is in the exclusive possession of another who fails or refuses to furnish this information, the contractor will so certify to TxDOT or the FHWA, as appropriate, and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.

(6) Incorporation of Provisions:  The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (6) in every subcontract, including procurements of materials and leases of \\x0cRevised August 2018*   21 – 25  equipment, unless exempt by the Acts, the Regulations and directives issued pursuant thereto.

Provided, that if the contractor becomes involved in litigation with, or is threatened with litigation by, a subcontractor or supplier because of such direction, the contractor may request TxDOT to enter into any litigation to protect the interests of TxDOT.  In addition, the contractor may request the United States to enter into the litigation to protect the interests of the United States. (d) The contractor agrees to comply with the provisions of Appendix A attached hereto, which is incorporated by reference and made a part hereof. 6.11  E-VERIFY:  Pursuant to Executive Order RP-80, Vendor certifies and ensures that for all contracts for services, Vendor shall, to the extent permitted by law, utilize the United States Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify system during the term of this agreement to determine the eligibility of: (a) All persons employed by Vendor during the term of this agreement to perform duties within the State of Texas; and (b) All persons, including subcontractors, assigned by Vendor to perform work pursuant to this agreement. Violation of this provision constitutes a material breach of this agreement. PART 7.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION 7.01  DISPUTE RESOLUTION:  In accordance with Government Code, Chapter 2260, TxDOT has established a dispute resolution process in 43 Texas Administrative Code §§9.1 and 9.2 to resolve disputes that may arise between TxDOT and the vendor under the purchase order in 43 Texas Administrative Code §§9.1 and 9.2 (the dispute resolution process described by Government Code Chapter 2260 and 43 TAC §§9.1 and 9.2 referred to herein as the “dispute resolution process”).  The dispute resolution process shall be used by TxDOT and the vendor to resolve disputes arising under the purchase order, including without limitation any claim for breach of contract.  The contested case process provided in Chapter 2260 is the vendor’s sole and exclusive process for seeking a remedy for an alleged breach of contract by TxDOT if the parties are unable to resolve their disputes as described above.  Compliance with the contested case process provided in Chapter 2260 is a condition precedent to seeking consent to sue from the Legislature under Chapter 107, Civil Practices and Remedies Code.  Neither the execution of the contract by TxDOT nor any other conduct of any representative of TxDOT relating to the contract shall be considered a waiver of sovereign immunity to suit.  Notwithstanding any provision of the purchase order to the contrary, unless otherwise agreed in writing by TxDOT, the vendor shall continue performance and shall not be excused from performance during the period of contract claim or dispute is pending; however, the vendor may suspend performance during the pendency of such claim or dispute if the vendor has complied with all provisions of Section 2251.051, Texas Government Code, and such suspension of performance is expressly applicable and authorized under that law. PART 8.  CONTRACT TERMS 8.01  TERM OF CONTRACT:  The term of the contract shall be as stated on the purchase order. 8.02  ORDER OF PRECEDENCE:  In the event of conflicts or inconsistencies between this contract and its exhibits or attachments, such conflicts or inconsistencies shall be resolved by reference to the documents in the order specified on the purchase order. 8.03  TERMINATION OF A PURCHASE ORDER (a) FOR CAUSE: If vendor fails to provide a good or service according to the provisions of the purchase order or fails to comply with any term or condition of the purchase order, or if any representation or certification made in the purchase order or any related document is false, incomplete or inaccurate, TxDOT may immediately terminate the purchase order upon written notice to the vendor.  TxDOT may, at its option, re-solicit or award the purchase order to the next lowest responsive and responsible respondent.  The defaulting vendor will not be considered in the re-solicitation and may not be considered in future solicitations for the same type of work \\x0cRevised August 2018*   22 – 25  unless the specification or scope of work is significantly changed.  If vendor defaults on the purchase order, TxDOT may purchase the goods or service elsewhere and charge any increase in cost to the defaulting vendor.  TxDOT may impose sanctions, debar or suspend the vendor for abandonment or default(s) on the purchase order.  Termination is not an exclusive remedy, but will be in addition to any other remedies TxDOT may have by law, in equity, or under the contract.  TxDOT may exercise any other right, remedy or privilege which may be available to it under applicable law or may proceed by appropriate court action to enforce the provisions of the contract.  The exercise of any of the foregoing remedies will not constitute a termination of the contract unless TxDOT notifies the vendor in writing prior to the exercise of such remedy.  The vendor shall be responsible for all costs and expenses, including court costs, incurred by TxDOT with respect to the enforcement of any of the remedies listed herein. (b) FOR CONVENIENCE:  The purchase order may be terminated in whole or in part, without penalty, by either party by providing thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.  In the event of such termination, the vendor shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing, cease all work immediately upon the effective date of termination.  TxDOT will be liable only for payments for goods or services ordered before the termination date.  With regard to services, TxDOT will pay the vendor the purchase order price prorated for acceptable service performed up to the date specified in the notice of termination.  Termination under this paragraph shall not relieve the vendor of any obligation or liability that has occurred prior to termination.  The vendor shall refund any balance of unused prepaid funds. 8.04  SALE OR ASSIGNMENT:  The purchase order is void if sold or assigned to another company without written approval from TxDOT.  Written notification of changes to company name, address, telephone number, etc. shall be provided to TxDOT as soon as possible but not later than thirty (30) days from the date of change. 8.05  RENEWAL OF BLANKET PURCHASE ORDER FOR GOODS:  A blanket purchase order for goods may be renewed for up to three additional like periods of time at the original price, terms and conditions, and any approved changes.  Any changes will be clearly detailed in the amended purchase order. 8.06  RENEWAL OF PURCHASE ORDER FOR SERVICES:  The purchase order may be renewed for up to three additional like periods of time at the same terms and conditions, or as otherwise stated in the solicitation, provided both parties agree in writing to do so prior to the expiration of the purchase order. 8.07  RENEWAL OF PURCHASE ORDER FOR NEGOTIATED GOODS OR SERVICES (a) The purchase order may be renewed for up to three additional like periods of time at the same terms and conditions, or as otherwise stated in the solicitation, provided both parties agree in writing to do so prior to the expiration of the purchase order. (b) For purchase orders issued using the RFP or RFO method of purchase, TxDOT reserves the right to negotiate additional time if circumstances require.  TxDOT and the vendor may negotiate additional time and price based on the deliverable or need in the best interest of the state and TxDOT. 8.08  EXTENSION OF PURCHASE ORDERS (a) TxDOT reserves the right to extend a purchase order for time only past the stated term to allow the vendor to complete the requirements or to accommodate unanticipated events or requirements prior to the expiration of the purchase order. (b) A purchase order in its final renewal period may be further extended for time and money for a period up to ninety (90) days at the option of TxDOT. (c) The vendor may request a time only extension of a purchase order by submitting written justification to TxDOT.  TxDOT will approve or decline the request for extension in writing.  An extension will only be effective if it is issued by the TxDOT purchasing department in the form of a purchase order change notice.  \\x0cRevised August 2018*   23 – 25  8.09  SEVERABILITY CLAUSE:  In the event that any provision(s) of this purchase order may later be determined to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, then the remaining provisions of this purchase order shall remain in full force and effect. 8.10  BINDING EFFECT AND SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS  (a) By executing this purchase order, the vendor binds itself, its respective successors and assignees, to the faithful performance of the terms and conditions and provisions of the purchase order. (b) Expiration or termination of the purchase order for any reason shall not release vendor from any liabilities or obligations set forth in the terms and conditions and purchase order or any work order that are expressly stated to survive any such expiration or termination or which by their nature are intended to be applicable following such expiration or termination, including any and all provisions regarding confidentiality, indemnification, transition, records, audit, property rights, dispute resolution, invoice and fees verification.  Upon expiration or termination of the purchase order for any reason, TxDOT shall retain ownership of all associated work products and documentation obtained from or created by the vendor under the purchase order. Vendor shall deliver all documents or other work product to TxDOT upon request, including original versions if so specified in the request. (c) The term of service stated on the purchase order is binding on the vendor regardless of the term on the originating agency contract or its purchase order.   \\x0cRevised August 2018*   24 – 25  Appendix A  During the performance of this contract, the contractor, for itself, its assignees, and successors in interest (hereinafter referred to in this Appendix A as the \"contractor\\'\\') agrees to comply with the following nondiscrimination statutes and authorities; including but not limited to:  Pertinent Nondiscrimination Authorities:  • Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq., 78 stat. 252), (prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin); and 49 CFR Part 21. • The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, (42 U.S.C. § 4601), (prohibits unfair treatment of persons displaced or whose property has been acquired because of Federal or Federal-aid programs  and projects); • Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973, (23 U.S.C. § 324 et seq.), (prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex); • Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, (29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq.), as amended, (prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability); and 49 CFR Part 27; • The Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, (42 U.S.C. § 6101 et seq.), (prohibits discrimination on the basis of age); • Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, (49 U.S.C. § 4 71, Section 4 7123), as amended, (prohibits discrimination based on race, creed, color, national origin, or sex); • The Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, (PL 100-209), (Broadened the scope, coverage and applicability of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation  Act of 1973, by expanding the definition of the terms \"programs or activities\" to include all of the programs or activities of the Federal-aid recipients, subrecipients and contractors, whether such programs or activities are Federally funded or not); • Titles II and Ill of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability in the operation of public entities, public and private transportation systems, places of public accommodation, and certain testing entities (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12189) as implemented by Department of Transportation regulations at 49 C.F.R. parts 37 and 38; • The Federal Aviation Administration\\'s Nondiscrimination statute (49 U.S.C. § 47123) (prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, and sex); • Executive Order 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, which ensures non-discrimination against minority populations by discouraging programs, policies, and activities with disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority and low-income populations; • Executive Order 13166, Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency, and resulting agency guidance, national origin discrimination includes discrimination because of limited English proficiency (LEP).

SUBMIT PROPOSAL TO:  City of La Mirada Attn: City Clerk’s Office 13700 La Mirada Blvd. La Mirada, CA 90638 (562) 943 – 0131    \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  2   I. REQUEST SUMMARY  The City of La Mirada is seeking proposals from firms to provide investment advisory and portfolio management services for approximately $75 million in operating and capital funds (non-pension).  The term will be three years, with two one year options, which may be exercised at the City’s discretion.  The selected firm(s) will be responsible for performing in accordance with the scope of services, as further detailed in Section III.  II. INTRODUCTION A. Community Profile  The City was incorporated in 1960 and is a general law city with a population of approximately 49,000. The City Council is comprised of five elected citizens, with the City Manager as the administrative and executive head of the City. The City employs 73 full-time employees and approximately 300 part-time employees.  The City of La Mirada provides public safety services, public works, parks and community services, planning, building and safety, and code enforcement. The City’s award winning Theatre for the Performing Arts and Splash! La Mirada Regional Aquatics Center provide exceptional cultural and recreational opportunities for residents and guests. The City contracts with Los Angeles County for law enforcement, animal control and building services.  The total adopted budget for Fiscal Year 2018-19 is approximately $72 million, excluding transfers, of which $35.6 million are General Fund expenditures.    B. Background  The City’s primary investment objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on public funds while minimizing the potential for capital losses arising from market changes or issuer default. Although the generation of revenues through interest earnings on investments is an appropriate City goal, the primary consideration in the investment of City funds is capital preservation in the overall portfolio. As such, the City’s yield objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on City investments rather than the maximum generation of income, which could expose the City to unacceptable levels of risk.  While the City has utilized a vendor for this service since 2008, this RFP is being issued in compliance with internal requirements to periodically solicit proposals.   C. General RFP Submittal Information  The City’s designated staff will evaluate proposals received. During the review process, the City reserves the right, where it may serve the City’s best interest, to request additional information or clarification from those that submit proposals, or \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  3   allow clarifications, corrections of errors, or omissions. Any and all changes in the RFP will be made by written addendum, which shall be issued by the City to all prospective proposers who have registered for the RFP via the City’s website.  The City reserves the right to retain all proposals submitted. Submission of a proposal indicates the proposer’s acceptance of the conditions contained in this RFP, unless clearly and specifically noted in the proposal submitted and confirmed in the contract between the City and the proposer selected.  The preparation of the proposal will be at the total expense of the proposer. There is no expressed or implied obligation for the City to reimburse responding proposers for any expense incurred in the preparation of proposals in response to this request. All proposals submitted to the City shall become properties of the City and will not be returned. If any information in a proposal is confidential and/or proprietary, please further submit a separate, redacted copy for servicing public records requests.  The proposer may submit an alternative proposal (or proposals) that it believes will also meet the City\\'s project objectives; but in a different way. In this case, the proposer must provide an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the alternatives, and discuss under what circumstances the City would prefer one alternative to the other(s). If an alternative proposal is submitted, the maximum length of the proposal may be expanded proportionately by the number of alternatives submitted.  The City reserves the right to reject any or all proposals, in whole or part, to waive any informality in any proposal, and to accept the proposal which, in its discretion, is in the best interest of the City. Any proposer may withdraw his/her proposal, without obligation, at any time prior to the scheduled closing time for receipt of proposals. A withdrawal will not be effective unless made personally, telephonic, or electronic notification received prior to the closing date. Proposals may later be referred to the City Council for appropriate action.  All proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. on Monday, February 25, 2019 at which time they will be opened at the City Clerk’s Office. Late submissions will not be accepted. To be considered, proposers must send four (4) hard copies of their proposal in a sealed envelope with the name of the company submitting the proposal and the title of “Investment Advisory and Portfolio Management Services” to:  City of La Mirada City Clerk 13700 La Mirada Blvd. La Mirada, CA 90638   \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  4   For a complete list of the City’s RFP submittal terms and conditions, legal statements, and insurance requirements, please refer to the exhibits attached hereto.

Responses do not become contracts unless and until they are accepted through an authorized TxDOT designee by issuance of a purchase order.  In determining the best value for the state, the purchase price and whether the goods or services meet specifications are the most important considerations, unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. (a) BEST VALUE CRITERIA FOR PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES:  When specified in the solicitation, the factors listed in Government Code Section 2155.074 will be considered in making a best value award.  This section allows TxDOT to apply best value criteria in order to obtain goods and services that provide the best value for TxDOT.  Under these guidelines, a respondent is not automatically awarded a purchase order if they submit the lowest bid response.  TxDOT will be the sole judge as to which response is the most advantageous and in the best interest of TxDOT.  In determining best value, factors other than price may be considered in making an award.  Those factors are: (1) life cycle costs; (2) the quality and reliability of goods and services; (3) the delivery terms; \\x0cRevised August 2018*   5 – 25  (4) indicators of probable vendor performance; (5) cost of employee training associated with a purchase; (6) the effect of a purchase on agency productivity; and (7) other factors relevant to determining best value for the state in the context of a particular purchase. (b) BEST VALUE CRITERIA FOR RFO PURCHASES:  Best value criteria will be used on all information technology equipment or service purchases.  Those best value criteria include but are not limited to: (1) compatibility to facilitate exchange of existing data; (2) capacity for expansion and upgrading to more advanced levels of technology; (3) quantitative reliability factors; (4) level of training required to bring end-users to a stated level of proficiency; (5) technical support requirements for maintenance of data across a network platform and management of the networks hardware and software; (6) items, features, etc., which are in addition to requirements listed, as well as factors which, in TxDOT’s opinion, add value to the product or service but are not specifically required within the solicitation. (c) NEGOTIATIONS FOR RFO AND RFP PURCHASES:  TxDOT reserves the right to conduct formal negotiations with respondent(s) judged to have the best offer pertaining to price, goods, services and terms. (d) TxDOT reserves the right to reject a response from a respondent whose goods or services to TxDOT or other state agencies have been documented as unsatisfactory in providing the same goods or service. (e) TIE RESPONSES:  In case of tie responses, one or more preferences described in Government Code Chapter 2155 and 34 TAC §20.306 will be used to make an award.  Tie responses which cannot be resolved by application of one or more preferences shall be made by drawing lots. 2.08  PREFERENCES:  A respondent may claim a preference under 34 TAC §20.306.  To claim a preference, a respondent shall identify the preference on the solicitation or on the response to the solicitation.  If the appropriate area on the solicitation or response is not marked, a preference will not be granted unless other documents included in the response show a right to the preference. 2.09  DELIVERY:  No substitutions or cancellations will be permitted without written approval from TxDOT, which approval must be issued in the form of a purchase order change notice issued by TxDOT’s purchasing department. (a) If delay is foreseen, vendor shall give written notice to TxDOT.  TxDOT has the right to extend delivery or service date if reasons appear valid.  Vendor shall keep TxDOT advised at all times of the status of the order. Default in promised delivery or service date (unless vendor has received a written extension of the delivery or service date which has been signed by TxDOT), or failure to meet specifications, authorizes  TxDOT to purchase goods or services elsewhere and charge the full increase, if any, in cost and handling to defaulting vendor. (b) Delivery shall be made between 8 AM and 4 PM Monday through Friday except on regularly observed state or federal holidays, unless prior approval has been obtained from TxDOT or otherwise stated in the solicitation. (c) Receipt of goods or services does not constitute acceptance. (d) Goods and materials shall be properly packaged.  Damaged goods and materials will not be accepted.  If the damage is not readily apparent at the time of delivery, the goods shall be returned to the vendor at no cost to TxDOT.  TxDOT reserves the right to inspect goods at a \\x0cRevised August 2018*   6 – 25  reasonable time subsequent to delivery where circumstances or conditions prevent effective inspection of the goods at the time of delivery. 2.10  INSPECTIONS AND TESTS:  Goods will be subject to inspection and test by TxDOT to the extent practicable at all times and places.  Tests will be performed on samples taken from regular shipment.  In the event samples tested fail to meet all conditions and requirements of the specification, the cost of the sample used and the cost of the testing shall be borne by the vendor.  Goods which have been delivered and rejected in whole or in part may, at TxDOT’s option, be returned to the vendor or held for disposition at vendor’s risk and expense.  Latent defects may result in revocation of acceptance.   Acceptance of services shall be based on attainment of performance in accord with specifications and the purchase order. 2.11  VENDOR PERFORMANCE:  State agencies shall report a vendor\\'s performance on any purchase of $25,000 or more from contracts administered by the commission or any other purchase made through an agency\\'s delegated authority or a purchase made pursuant to the authority in Government Code, Title 10, Subtitle D or a purchase exempt from CPA/SPD procurement rules and procedures.  Past Performance:  A Respondent\\'s past performance will be measured based upon pass/fail criteria, in compliance with applicable provisions of §2155.074, 2155.075, 2156.007, 2157.003, and 2157.125, Government Code. Respondents may fail this selection criterion for any of the following conditions:  • A letter grade score below ‘C’ in the Vendor Performance System, or a score of “legacy unsatisfactory” for historic reports submitted prior to the implementation of the current rating system,  • Being currently under a Corrective Action Plan through the CPA, • Having repeated negative Vendor Performance Reports for the same reason, • Having purchase orders that have been cancelled or terminated in the previous 12 months for non-performance (i.e. late delivery, etc.).  Vendor performance information is located on the CPA website at: http://www.txsmartbuy.com/vpts  TxDOT may conduct reference checks with other entities regarding past performance. In addition to evaluating performance through the Vendor Performance Tracking System (as authorized by 34 Texas Administrative Code §20.108) TxDOT may examine other sources of vendor performance including, but not limited to, notices of termination, cure notices, assessments of liquidated damages, litigation, audit reports, and non-renewals of contracts.  Any such investigations shall be at the sole discretion of TxDOT, and any negative findings, as determined by TxDOT, may result in non-award to the Respondent. PART 3.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION 7.01  DISPUTE RESOLUTION:  In accordance with Government Code, Chapter 2260, TxDOT has established a dispute resolution process in 43 Texas Administrative Code §§9.1 and 9.2 to resolve disputes that may arise between TxDOT and the vendor under the purchase order in 43 Texas Administrative Code §§9.1 and 9.2 (the dispute resolution process described by Government Code Chapter 2260 and 43 TAC §§9.1 and 9.2 referred to herein as the “dispute resolution process”).  The dispute resolution process shall be used by TxDOT and the vendor to resolve disputes arising under the purchase order, including without limitation any claim for breach of contract.  The contested case process provided in Chapter 2260 is the vendor’s sole and exclusive process for seeking a remedy for an alleged breach of contract by TxDOT if the parties are unable to resolve their disputes as described above.  Compliance with the contested case process provided in Chapter 2260 is a condition precedent to seeking consent to sue from the Legislature under Chapter 107, Civil Practices and Remedies Code.  Neither the execution of the contract by TxDOT nor any other conduct of any representative of TxDOT relating to the contract shall be considered a waiver of sovereign immunity to suit.  Notwithstanding any provision of the purchase order to the contrary, unless otherwise agreed in writing by TxDOT, the vendor shall continue performance and shall not be excused from performance during the period of contract claim or dispute is pending; however, the vendor may suspend performance during the pendency of such claim or dispute if the vendor has complied with all provisions of Section 2251.051, Texas Government Code, and such suspension of performance is expressly applicable and authorized under that law. PART 8.  CONTRACT TERMS 8.01  TERM OF CONTRACT:  The term of the contract shall be as stated on the purchase order. 8.02  ORDER OF PRECEDENCE:  In the event of conflicts or inconsistencies between this contract and its exhibits or attachments, such conflicts or inconsistencies shall be resolved by reference to the documents in the order specified on the purchase order. 8.03  TERMINATION OF A PURCHASE ORDER (a) FOR CAUSE: If vendor fails to provide a good or service according to the provisions of the purchase order or fails to comply with any term or condition of the purchase order, or if any representation or certification made in the purchase order or any related document is false, incomplete or inaccurate, TxDOT may immediately terminate the purchase order upon written notice to the vendor.  TxDOT may, at its option, re-solicit or award the purchase order to the next lowest responsive and responsible respondent.  The defaulting vendor will not be considered in the re-solicitation and may not be considered in future solicitations for the same type of work \\x0cRevised August 2018*   22 – 25  unless the specification or scope of work is significantly changed.  If vendor defaults on the purchase order, TxDOT may purchase the goods or service elsewhere and charge any increase in cost to the defaulting vendor.  TxDOT may impose sanctions, debar or suspend the vendor for abandonment or default(s) on the purchase order.  Termination is not an exclusive remedy, but will be in addition to any other remedies TxDOT may have by law, in equity, or under the contract.  TxDOT may exercise any other right, remedy or privilege which may be available to it under applicable law or may proceed by appropriate court action to enforce the provisions of the contract.  The exercise of any of the foregoing remedies will not constitute a termination of the contract unless TxDOT notifies the vendor in writing prior to the exercise of such remedy.  The vendor shall be responsible for all costs and expenses, including court costs, incurred by TxDOT with respect to the enforcement of any of the remedies listed herein. (b) FOR CONVENIENCE:  The purchase order may be terminated in whole or in part, without penalty, by either party by providing thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.  In the event of such termination, the vendor shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing, cease all work immediately upon the effective date of termination.  TxDOT will be liable only for payments for goods or services ordered before the termination date.  With regard to services, TxDOT will pay the vendor the purchase order price prorated for acceptable service performed up to the date specified in the notice of termination.

SUBMIT PROPOSAL TO:  City of La Mirada Attn: City Clerk’s Office 13700 La Mirada Blvd. La Mirada, CA 90638 (562) 943 – 0131    \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  2   I. REQUEST SUMMARY  The City of La Mirada is seeking proposals from firms to provide investment advisory and portfolio management services for approximately $75 million in operating and capital funds (non-pension).  The term will be three years, with two one year options, which may be exercised at the City’s discretion.  The selected firm(s) will be responsible for performing in accordance with the scope of services, as further detailed in Section III.  II. INTRODUCTION A. Community Profile  The City was incorporated in 1960 and is a general law city with a population of approximately 49,000. The City Council is comprised of five elected citizens, with the City Manager as the administrative and executive head of the City. The City employs 73 full-time employees and approximately 300 part-time employees.  The City of La Mirada provides public safety services, public works, parks and community services, planning, building and safety, and code enforcement. The City’s award winning Theatre for the Performing Arts and Splash! La Mirada Regional Aquatics Center provide exceptional cultural and recreational opportunities for residents and guests. The City contracts with Los Angeles County for law enforcement, animal control and building services.  The total adopted budget for Fiscal Year 2018-19 is approximately $72 million, excluding transfers, of which $35.6 million are General Fund expenditures.    B. Background  The City’s primary investment objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on public funds while minimizing the potential for capital losses arising from market changes or issuer default. Although the generation of revenues through interest earnings on investments is an appropriate City goal, the primary consideration in the investment of City funds is capital preservation in the overall portfolio. As such, the City’s yield objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on City investments rather than the maximum generation of income, which could expose the City to unacceptable levels of risk.  While the City has utilized a vendor for this service since 2008, this RFP is being issued in compliance with internal requirements to periodically solicit proposals.   C. General RFP Submittal Information  The City’s designated staff will evaluate proposals received. During the review process, the City reserves the right, where it may serve the City’s best interest, to request additional information or clarification from those that submit proposals, or \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  3   allow clarifications, corrections of errors, or omissions. Any and all changes in the RFP will be made by written addendum, which shall be issued by the City to all prospective proposers who have registered for the RFP via the City’s website.  The City reserves the right to retain all proposals submitted. Submission of a proposal indicates the proposer’s acceptance of the conditions contained in this RFP, unless clearly and specifically noted in the proposal submitted and confirmed in the contract between the City and the proposer selected.  The preparation of the proposal will be at the total expense of the proposer. There is no expressed or implied obligation for the City to reimburse responding proposers for any expense incurred in the preparation of proposals in response to this request. All proposals submitted to the City shall become properties of the City and will not be returned. If any information in a proposal is confidential and/or proprietary, please further submit a separate, redacted copy for servicing public records requests.  The proposer may submit an alternative proposal (or proposals) that it believes will also meet the City\\'s project objectives; but in a different way. In this case, the proposer must provide an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the alternatives, and discuss under what circumstances the City would prefer one alternative to the other(s). If an alternative proposal is submitted, the maximum length of the proposal may be expanded proportionately by the number of alternatives submitted.  The City reserves the right to reject any or all proposals, in whole or part, to waive any informality in any proposal, and to accept the proposal which, in its discretion, is in the best interest of the City. Any proposer may withdraw his/her proposal, without obligation, at any time prior to the scheduled closing time for receipt of proposals. A withdrawal will not be effective unless made personally, telephonic, or electronic notification received prior to the closing date. Proposals may later be referred to the City Council for appropriate action.  All proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. on Monday, February 25, 2019 at which time they will be opened at the City Clerk’s Office. Late submissions will not be accepted. To be considered, proposers must send four (4) hard copies of their proposal in a sealed envelope with the name of the company submitting the proposal and the title of “Investment Advisory and Portfolio Management Services” to:  City of La Mirada City Clerk 13700 La Mirada Blvd. La Mirada, CA 90638   \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  4   For a complete list of the City’s RFP submittal terms and conditions, legal statements, and insurance requirements, please refer to the exhibits attached hereto.

The response will not be considered for award but will be retained by TxDOT according to the response information confidentiality provision referenced in Section 2.05 (c). 2.07  DETERMINING AWARD:  A response to a solicitation is an offer to contract with TxDOT based upon the terms, conditions and specifications contained in the solicitation.  Responses do not become contracts unless and until they are accepted through an authorized TxDOT designee by issuance of a purchase order.  In determining the best value for the state, the purchase price and whether the goods or services meet specifications are the most important considerations, unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. (a) BEST VALUE CRITERIA FOR PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES:  When specified in the solicitation, the factors listed in Government Code Section 2155.074 will be considered in making a best value award.  This section allows TxDOT to apply best value criteria in order to obtain goods and services that provide the best value for TxDOT.  Under these guidelines, a respondent is not automatically awarded a purchase order if they submit the lowest bid response.  TxDOT will be the sole judge as to which response is the most advantageous and in the best interest of TxDOT.  In determining best value, factors other than price may be considered in making an award.  Those factors are: (1) life cycle costs; (2) the quality and reliability of goods and services; (3) the delivery terms; \\x0cRevised August 2018*   5 – 25  (4) indicators of probable vendor performance; (5) cost of employee training associated with a purchase; (6) the effect of a purchase on agency productivity; and (7) other factors relevant to determining best value for the state in the context of a particular purchase. (b) BEST VALUE CRITERIA FOR RFO PURCHASES:  Best value criteria will be used on all information technology equipment or service purchases.  Those best value criteria include but are not limited to: (1) compatibility to facilitate exchange of existing data; (2) capacity for expansion and upgrading to more advanced levels of technology; (3) quantitative reliability factors; (4) level of training required to bring end-users to a stated level of proficiency; (5) technical support requirements for maintenance of data across a network platform and management of the networks hardware and software; (6) items, features, etc., which are in addition to requirements listed, as well as factors which, in TxDOT’s opinion, add value to the product or service but are not specifically required within the solicitation. (c) NEGOTIATIONS FOR RFO AND RFP PURCHASES:  TxDOT reserves the right to conduct formal negotiations with respondent(s) judged to have the best offer pertaining to price, goods, services and terms. (d) TxDOT reserves the right to reject a response from a respondent whose goods or services to TxDOT or other state agencies have been documented as unsatisfactory in providing the same goods or service. (e) TIE RESPONSES:  In case of tie responses, one or more preferences described in Government Code Chapter 2155 and 34 TAC §20.306 will be used to make an award.  Tie responses which cannot be resolved by application of one or more preferences shall be made by drawing lots. 2.08  PREFERENCES:  A respondent may claim a preference under 34 TAC §20.306.  To claim a preference, a respondent shall identify the preference on the solicitation or on the response to the solicitation.  If the appropriate area on the solicitation or response is not marked, a preference will not be granted unless other documents included in the response show a right to the preference. 2.09  DELIVERY:  No substitutions or cancellations will be permitted without written approval from TxDOT, which approval must be issued in the form of a purchase order change notice issued by TxDOT’s purchasing department. (a) If delay is foreseen, vendor shall give written notice to TxDOT.  TxDOT has the right to extend delivery or service date if reasons appear valid.  Vendor shall keep TxDOT advised at all times of the status of the order. Default in promised delivery or service date (unless vendor has received a written extension of the delivery or service date which has been signed by TxDOT), or failure to meet specifications, authorizes  TxDOT to purchase goods or services elsewhere and charge the full increase, if any, in cost and handling to defaulting vendor. (b) Delivery shall be made between 8 AM and 4 PM Monday through Friday except on regularly observed state or federal holidays, unless prior approval has been obtained from TxDOT or otherwise stated in the solicitation. (c) Receipt of goods or services does not constitute acceptance. (d) Goods and materials shall be properly packaged.  Damaged goods and materials will not be accepted.  If the damage is not readily apparent at the time of delivery, the goods shall be returned to the vendor at no cost to TxDOT.  TxDOT reserves the right to inspect goods at a \\x0cRevised August 2018*   6 – 25  reasonable time subsequent to delivery where circumstances or conditions prevent effective inspection of the goods at the time of delivery. 2.10  INSPECTIONS AND TESTS:  Goods will be subject to inspection and test by TxDOT to the extent practicable at all times and places.  Tests will be performed on samples taken from regular shipment.  In the event samples tested fail to meet all conditions and requirements of the specification, the cost of the sample used and the cost of the testing shall be borne by the vendor.  Goods which have been delivered and rejected in whole or in part may, at TxDOT’s option, be returned to the vendor or held for disposition at vendor’s risk and expense.  Latent defects may result in revocation of acceptance.   Acceptance of services shall be based on attainment of performance in accord with specifications and the purchase order. 2.11  VENDOR PERFORMANCE:  State agencies shall report a vendor\\'s performance on any purchase of $25,000 or more from contracts administered by the commission or any other purchase made through an agency\\'s delegated authority or a purchase made pursuant to the authority in Government Code, Title 10, Subtitle D or a purchase exempt from CPA/SPD procurement rules and procedures.  Past Performance:  A Respondent\\'s past performance will be measured based upon pass/fail criteria, in compliance with applicable provisions of §2155.074, 2155.075, 2156.007, 2157.003, and 2157.125, Government Code. Respondents may fail this selection criterion for any of the following conditions:  • A letter grade score below ‘C’ in the Vendor Performance System, or a score of “legacy unsatisfactory” for historic reports submitted prior to the implementation of the current rating system,  • Being currently under a Corrective Action Plan through the CPA, • Having repeated negative Vendor Performance Reports for the same reason, • Having purchase orders that have been cancelled or terminated in the previous 12 months for non-performance (i.e. late delivery, etc.).  Vendor performance information is located on the CPA website at: http://www.txsmartbuy.com/vpts  TxDOT may conduct reference checks with other entities regarding past performance. In addition to evaluating performance through the Vendor Performance Tracking System (as authorized by 34 Texas Administrative Code §20.108) TxDOT may examine other sources of vendor performance including, but not limited to, notices of termination, cure notices, assessments of liquidated damages, litigation, audit reports, and non-renewals of contracts.  Any such investigations shall be at the sole discretion of TxDOT, and any negative findings, as determined by TxDOT, may result in non-award to the Respondent. PART 3.

The defaulting vendor will not be considered in the re-solicitation and may not be considered in future solicitations for the same type of work \\x0cRevised August 2018*   22 – 25  unless the specification or scope of work is significantly changed.  If vendor defaults on the purchase order, TxDOT may purchase the goods or service elsewhere and charge any increase in cost to the defaulting vendor.  TxDOT may impose sanctions, debar or suspend the vendor for abandonment or default(s) on the purchase order.  Termination is not an exclusive remedy, but will be in addition to any other remedies TxDOT may have by law, in equity, or under the contract.  TxDOT may exercise any other right, remedy or privilege which may be available to it under applicable law or may proceed by appropriate court action to enforce the provisions of the contract.  The exercise of any of the foregoing remedies will not constitute a termination of the contract unless TxDOT notifies the vendor in writing prior to the exercise of such remedy.

SUBMIT PROPOSAL TO:  City of La Mirada Attn: City Clerk’s Office 13700 La Mirada Blvd. La Mirada, CA 90638 (562) 943 – 0131    \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  2   I. REQUEST SUMMARY  The City of La Mirada is seeking proposals from firms to provide investment advisory and portfolio management services for approximately $75 million in operating and capital funds (non-pension).  The term will be three years, with two one year options, which may be exercised at the City’s discretion.  The selected firm(s) will be responsible for performing in accordance with the scope of services, as further detailed in Section III.  II. INTRODUCTION A. Community Profile  The City was incorporated in 1960 and is a general law city with a population of approximately 49,000. The City Council is comprised of five elected citizens, with the City Manager as the administrative and executive head of the City. The City employs 73 full-time employees and approximately 300 part-time employees.  The City of La Mirada provides public safety services, public works, parks and community services, planning, building and safety, and code enforcement. The City’s award winning Theatre for the Performing Arts and Splash! La Mirada Regional Aquatics Center provide exceptional cultural and recreational opportunities for residents and guests. The City contracts with Los Angeles County for law enforcement, animal control and building services.  The total adopted budget for Fiscal Year 2018-19 is approximately $72 million, excluding transfers, of which $35.6 million are General Fund expenditures.    B. Background  The City’s primary investment objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on public funds while minimizing the potential for capital losses arising from market changes or issuer default. Although the generation of revenues through interest earnings on investments is an appropriate City goal, the primary consideration in the investment of City funds is capital preservation in the overall portfolio. As such, the City’s yield objective is to achieve a reasonable rate of return on City investments rather than the maximum generation of income, which could expose the City to unacceptable levels of risk.  While the City has utilized a vendor for this service since 2008, this RFP is being issued in compliance with internal requirements to periodically solicit proposals.   C. General RFP Submittal Information  The City’s designated staff will evaluate proposals received. During the review process, the City reserves the right, where it may serve the City’s best interest, to request additional information or clarification from those that submit proposals, or \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  3   allow clarifications, corrections of errors, or omissions. Any and all changes in the RFP will be made by written addendum, which shall be issued by the City to all prospective proposers who have registered for the RFP via the City’s website.  The City reserves the right to retain all proposals submitted. Submission of a proposal indicates the proposer’s acceptance of the conditions contained in this RFP, unless clearly and specifically noted in the proposal submitted and confirmed in the contract between the City and the proposer selected.  The preparation of the proposal will be at the total expense of the proposer. There is no expressed or implied obligation for the City to reimburse responding proposers for any expense incurred in the preparation of proposals in response to this request. All proposals submitted to the City shall become properties of the City and will not be returned. If any information in a proposal is confidential and/or proprietary, please further submit a separate, redacted copy for servicing public records requests.  The proposer may submit an alternative proposal (or proposals) that it believes will also meet the City\\'s project objectives; but in a different way. In this case, the proposer must provide an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each of the alternatives, and discuss under what circumstances the City would prefer one alternative to the other(s). If an alternative proposal is submitted, the maximum length of the proposal may be expanded proportionately by the number of alternatives submitted.  The City reserves the right to reject any or all proposals, in whole or part, to waive any informality in any proposal, and to accept the proposal which, in its discretion, is in the best interest of the City. Any proposer may withdraw his/her proposal, without obligation, at any time prior to the scheduled closing time for receipt of proposals. A withdrawal will not be effective unless made personally, telephonic, or electronic notification received prior to the closing date. Proposals may later be referred to the City Council for appropriate action.  All proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. on Monday, February 25, 2019 at which time they will be opened at the City Clerk’s Office. Late submissions will not be accepted. To be considered, proposers must send four (4) hard copies of their proposal in a sealed envelope with the name of the company submitting the proposal and the title of “Investment Advisory and Portfolio Management Services” to:  City of La Mirada City Clerk 13700 La Mirada Blvd. La Mirada, CA 90638   \\x0cCity of La Mirada Investment Services (RFP)  4   For a complete list of the City’s RFP submittal terms and conditions, legal statements, and insurance requirements, please refer to the exhibits attached hereto.

(i) TxDOT reserves the right to accept or reject all or any part of any response, waive minor technicalities and make an award to best serve the interests of the State.  TxDOT reserves the right to reject any response not prepared and submitted in accordance with the solicitation requirements.

Therefore, the respondent shall clearly identify in the response any confidential or proprietary information.  Proprietary information identified by the respondent in the response, will be kept confidential by TxDOT to the extent permitted by state law.  TxDOT merely raises the exception on behalf of the vendor.  TxDOT takes no legal position on disclosure.  TxDOT will use best efforts to give the respondent or the awarded vendor an opportunity to present to the Office of the Attorney General its arguments for non-disclosure of its identified confidential or proprietary information. 2.06  ALTERATIONS OR WITHDRAWAL OF RESPONSES (a) Any alterations to a response made before the opening or closing date and time shall be initialed by respondent or authorized agent.  Response cannot be altered or amended after the opening or closing date and time. (b) A response may be withdrawn if requested in writing prior to the opening or closing date and time.  A response may be withdrawn from consideration after the opening or closing date only with the approval of TxDOT based on respondent’s written, acceptable reason.  The response will not be considered for award but will be retained by TxDOT according to the response information confidentiality provision referenced in Section 2.05 (c). 2.07  DETERMINING AWARD:  A response to a solicitation is an offer to contract with TxDOT based upon the terms, conditions and specifications contained in the solicitation.  Responses do not become contracts unless and until they are accepted through an authorized TxDOT designee by issuance of a purchase order.  In determining the best value for the state, the purchase price and whether the goods or services meet specifications are the most important considerations, unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. (a) BEST VALUE CRITERIA FOR PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES:  When specified in the solicitation, the factors listed in Government Code Section 2155.074 will be considered in making a best value award.  This section allows TxDOT to apply best value criteria in order to obtain goods and services that provide the best value for TxDOT.  Under these guidelines, a respondent is not automatically awarded a purchase order if they submit the lowest bid response.  TxDOT will be the sole judge as to which response is the most advantageous and in the best interest of TxDOT.  In determining best value, factors other than price may be considered in making an award.  Those factors are: (1) life cycle costs; (2) the quality and reliability of goods and services; (3) the delivery terms; \\x0cRevised August 2018*   5 – 25  (4) indicators of probable vendor performance; (5) cost of employee training associated with a purchase; (6) the effect of a purchase on agency productivity; and (7) other factors relevant to determining best value for the state in the context of a particular purchase. (b) BEST VALUE CRITERIA FOR RFO PURCHASES:  Best value criteria will be used on all information technology equipment or service purchases.  Those best value criteria include but are not limited to: (1) compatibility to facilitate exchange of existing data; (2) capacity for expansion and upgrading to more advanced levels of technology; (3) quantitative reliability factors; (4) level of training required to bring end-users to a stated level of proficiency; (5) technical support requirements for maintenance of data across a network platform and management of the networks hardware and software; (6) items, features, etc., which are in addition to requirements listed, as well as factors which, in TxDOT’s opinion, add value to the product or service but are not specifically required within the solicitation. (c) NEGOTIATIONS FOR RFO AND RFP PURCHASES:  TxDOT reserves the right to conduct formal negotiations with respondent(s) judged to have the best offer pertaining to price, goods, services and terms. (d) TxDOT reserves the right to reject a response from a respondent whose goods or services to TxDOT or other state agencies have been documented as unsatisfactory in providing the same goods or service. (e) TIE RESPONSES:  In case of tie responses, one or more preferences described in Government Code Chapter 2155 and 34 TAC §20.306 will be used to make an award.  Tie responses which cannot be resolved by application of one or more preferences shall be made by drawing lots. 2.08  PREFERENCES:  A respondent may claim a preference under 34 TAC §20.306.

The vendor shall not participate either directly or indirectly in any discriminatory employment practices.  Failure by the vendor to carry out these requirements is a material breach of any contract awarded and may result in the termination of the contract or such other remedy as TxDOT deems appropriate. (b) In any solicitations for subcontractors, including procurements of materials or leases of equipment and in all solicitations either by competitive bidding or negotiation made by the vendor for work to be performed under a subcontract, each potential subcontractor or supplier shall be notified by the vendor of the vendor’s and subcontractor’s obligations under its purchase order relative to nondiscrimination on the grounds of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability. (c) During the performance of this contract, the contractor, for itself, its assignees and successors in interest (hereinafter referred to collectively in this subsection (c) as the “contractor”) agrees as follows: (1) Compliance with Regulations:  The contractor will comply with the Acts and the Regulations relative to Nondiscrimination in Federally-assisted programs of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, as they may be amended from time to time, which are herein incorporated by reference and made a part of this contract.

(3) Solicitations for Subcontracts, Including Procurements of Materials and Equipment:  In all solicitations, either by competitive bidding, or negotiation made by the contractor for work to be performed under a subcontract, including procurements of materials, or leases of equipment, each potential subcontractor or supplier will be notified by the contractor of the contractor’s obligations under this contract and the Acts and the Regulations relative to Nondiscrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin.

Where any information required of a contractor is in the exclusive possession of another who fails or refuses to furnish this information, the contractor will so certify to TxDOT or the FHWA, as appropriate, and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information. (5) Sanctions for Noncompliance:  In the event of a contractor’s noncompliance with the nondiscrimination provisions of this contract, TxDOT will impose such contract sanctions as it or the FHWA may determine to be appropriate, including, but not limited to: a) withholding payments to the contractor under the contract until the contractor complies; and/or b) cancelling, terminating, or suspending a contract, in whole or in part.

Provided, that if the contractor becomes involved in litigation with, or is threatened with litigation by, a subcontractor or supplier because of such direction, the contractor may request TxDOT to enter into any litigation to protect the interests of TxDOT.  In addition, the contractor may request the United States to enter into the litigation to protect the interests of the United States.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION 7.01  DISPUTE RESOLUTION:  In accordance with Government Code, Chapter 2260, TxDOT has established a dispute resolution process in 43 Texas Administrative Code §§9.1 and 9.2 to resolve disputes that may arise between TxDOT and the vendor under the purchase order in 43 Texas Administrative Code §§9.1 and 9.2 (the dispute resolution process described by Government Code Chapter 2260 and 43 TAC §§9.1 and 9.2 referred to herein as the “dispute resolution process”).  The dispute resolution process shall be used by TxDOT and the vendor to resolve disputes arising under the purchase order, including without limitation any claim for breach of contract.  The contested case process provided in Chapter 2260 is the vendor’s sole and exclusive process for seeking a remedy for an alleged breach of contract by TxDOT if the parties are unable to resolve their disputes as described above.  Compliance with the contested case process provided in Chapter 2260 is a condition precedent to seeking consent to sue from the Legislature under Chapter 107, Civil Practices and Remedies Code.  Neither the execution of the contract by TxDOT nor any other conduct of any representative of TxDOT relating to the contract shall be considered a waiver of sovereign immunity to suit.  Notwithstanding any provision of the purchase order to the contrary, unless otherwise agreed in writing by TxDOT, the vendor shall continue performance and shall not be excused from performance during the period of contract claim or dispute is pending; however, the vendor may suspend performance during the pendency of such claim or dispute if the vendor has complied with all provisions of Section 2251.051, Texas Government Code, and such suspension of performance is expressly applicable and authorized under that law. PART 8.  CONTRACT TERMS 8.01  TERM OF CONTRACT:  The term of the contract shall be as stated on the purchase order. 8.02  ORDER OF PRECEDENCE:  In the event of conflicts or inconsistencies between this contract and its exhibits or attachments, such conflicts or inconsistencies shall be resolved by reference to the documents in the order specified on the purchase order. 8.03  TERMINATION OF A PURCHASE ORDER (a) FOR CAUSE: If vendor fails to provide a good or service according to the provisions of the purchase order or fails to comply with any term or condition of the purchase order, or if any representation or certification made in the purchase order or any related document is false, incomplete or inaccurate, TxDOT may immediately terminate the purchase order upon written notice to the vendor.  TxDOT may, at its option, re-solicit or award the purchase order to the next lowest responsive and responsible respondent.  The defaulting vendor will not be considered in the re-solicitation and may not be considered in future solicitations for the same type of work \\x0cRevised August 2018*   22 – 25  unless the specification or scope of work is significantly changed.  If vendor defaults on the purchase order, TxDOT may purchase the goods or service elsewhere and charge any increase in cost to the defaulting vendor.  TxDOT may impose sanctions, debar or suspend the vendor for abandonment or default(s) on the purchase order.  Termination is not an exclusive remedy, but will be in addition to any other remedies TxDOT may have by law, in equity, or under the contract.  TxDOT may exercise any other right, remedy or privilege which may be available to it under applicable law or may proceed by appropriate court action to enforce the provisions of the contract.  The exercise of any of the foregoing remedies will not constitute a termination of the contract unless TxDOT notifies the vendor in writing prior to the exercise of such remedy.  The vendor shall be responsible for all costs and expenses, including court costs, incurred by TxDOT with respect to the enforcement of any of the remedies listed herein. (b) FOR CONVENIENCE:  The purchase order may be terminated in whole or in part, without penalty, by either party by providing thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.  In the event of such termination, the vendor shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing, cease all work immediately upon the effective date of termination.  TxDOT will be liable only for payments for goods or services ordered before the termination date.  With regard to services, TxDOT will pay the vendor the purchase order price prorated for acceptable service performed up to the date specified in the notice of termination.

The vendor shall refund any balance of unused prepaid funds. 8.04  SALE OR ASSIGNMENT:  The purchase order is void if sold or assigned to another company without written approval from TxDOT.

Any changes will be clearly detailed in the amended purchase order. 8.06  RENEWAL OF PURCHASE ORDER FOR SERVICES:  The purchase order may be renewed for up to three additional like periods of time at the same terms and conditions, or as otherwise stated in the solicitation, provided both parties agree in writing to do so prior to the expiration of the purchase order. 8.07  RENEWAL OF PURCHASE ORDER FOR NEGOTIATED GOODS OR SERVICES (a) The purchase order may be renewed for up to three additional like periods of time at the same terms and conditions, or as otherwise stated in the solicitation, provided both parties agree in writing to do so prior to the expiration of the purchase order. (b) For purchase orders issued using the RFP or RFO method of purchase, TxDOT reserves the right to negotiate additional time if circumstances require.  TxDOT and the vendor may negotiate additional time and price based on the deliverable or need in the best interest of the state and TxDOT. 8.08  EXTENSION OF PURCHASE ORDERS (a) TxDOT reserves the right to extend a purchase order for time only past the stated term to allow the vendor to complete the requirements or to accommodate unanticipated events or requirements prior to the expiration of the purchase order.

(c) The vendor may request a time only extension of a purchase order by submitting written justification to TxDOT.  TxDOT will approve or decline the request for extension in writing.  An extension will only be effective if it is issued by the TxDOT purchasing department in the form of a purchase order change notice.  \\x0cRevised August 2018*   23 – 25  8.09  SEVERABILITY CLAUSE:  In the event that any provision(s) of this purchase order may later be determined to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, then the remaining provisions of this purchase order shall remain in full force and effect. 8.10  BINDING EFFECT AND SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS  (a) By executing this purchase order, the vendor binds itself, its respective successors and assignees, to the faithful performance of the terms and conditions and provisions of the purchase order. (b) Expiration or termination of the purchase order for any reason shall not release vendor from any liabilities or obligations set forth in the terms and conditions and purchase order or any work order that are expressly stated to survive any such expiration or termination or which by their nature are intended to be applicable following such expiration or termination, including any and all provisions regarding confidentiality, indemnification, transition, records, audit, property rights, dispute resolution, invoice and fees verification.  Upon expiration or termination of the purchase order for any reason, TxDOT shall retain ownership of all associated work products and documentation obtained from or created by the vendor under the purchase order.
