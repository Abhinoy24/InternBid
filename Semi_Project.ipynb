Services should address the\\nhealth disparities as noted in the Califomia LGBTQ Reducing Mental Health Disparities\\nPopulation Report (2014): “LGBTQ individuals are seen as living outside the norm of expected\\nheterosexual and assigned gender behavior, and therefore may and do experience stigma,\\ndiscrimination and oppression from government, health systems, school systems, religious\\ninstitutions, employers, family members, and society at large.” Proposers shall have in-depth\\nknowledge and understanding of the behavioral health needs of the LGBTQ community,\\ndemonstrate knowledge and understanding of the value of peer support services, and possess\\n\\nexpertise in providing services that support LGBTQ individuals with mental health and/or\\nsubstance use challenges.\\n\\nBackground information\\n\\nA. The BHSD’s current Ethnic Cultural Communities Advisory Committee (ECCAC) Family\\nOutreach and Engagement Program provides peer support and prevention services to ethnic,\\nhigh-need communities that have been unserved 0r underserved. The ECCAC was designed\\nby mental health clients and family members and utilizes a successful model for serving the\\nethnic high-need communities. Staff have lived experience as clients, or as family members\\nof clients, and belong to the ethnic/cultural communities they serve. The program emphasizes\\nrespect, cooperation, collaboration with organizations in the community, resourcefulness, and\\ncreativity. The Proposer shall apply the existing ECCAC model to promote the provision of\\nproviding culturally competent and relevant prevention services to the LGBTQ community.\\n\\nB. Critical concerns identified by the LGBTQ community in a 2016 needs assessment prepared\\nby Family & Children Services of Silicon Valley included the following:\\n\\n1. Discrimination within the LGBTQ community\\n\\nStigma accessing mental health services\\n\\nLack of retention of LGBTQ histories\\n\\nVictimization of individuals with mental health challenges\\n\\nIsolation of older adults\\n\\n9‘5\"???)\\n\\nLack of communication across community\\n7.

Services should address the\\nhealth disparities as noted in the Califomia LGBTQ Reducing Mental Health Disparities\\nPopulation Report (2014): “LGBTQ individuals are seen as living outside the norm of expected\\nheterosexual and assigned gender behavior, and therefore may and do experience stigma,\\ndiscrimination and oppression from government, health systems, school systems, religious\\ninstitutions, employers, family members, and society at large.” Proposers shall have in-depth\\nknowledge and understanding of the behavioral health needs of the LGBTQ community,\\ndemonstrate knowledge and understanding of the value of peer support services, and possess\\n\\nexpertise in providing services that support LGBTQ individuals with mental health and/or\\nsubstance use challenges.\\n\\nBackground information\\n\\nA. The BHSD’s current Ethnic Cultural Communities Advisory Committee (ECCAC) Family\\nOutreach and Engagement Program provides peer support and prevention services to ethnic,\\nhigh-need communities that have been unserved 0r underserved. The ECCAC was designed\\nby mental health clients and family members and utilizes a successful model for serving the\\nethnic high-need communities. Staff have lived experience as clients, or as family members\\nof clients, and belong to the ethnic/cultural communities they serve. The program emphasizes\\nrespect, cooperation, collaboration with organizations in the community, resourcefulness, and\\ncreativity. The Proposer shall apply the existing ECCAC model to promote the provision of\\nproviding culturally competent and relevant prevention services to the LGBTQ community.\\n\\nB. Critical concerns identified by the LGBTQ community in a 2016 needs assessment prepared\\nby Family & Children Services of Silicon Valley included the following:\\n\\n1. Discrimination within the LGBTQ community\\n\\nStigma accessing mental health services\\n\\nLack of retention of LGBTQ histories\\n\\nVictimization of individuals with mental health challenges\\n\\nIsolation of older adults\\n\\n9‘5\"???)\\n\\nLack of communication across community\\n7. Lack of family support\\n\\nC. Data from the LGBTQ Health Assessment, Status ofLGBTQ Health Santa Clara County\\n2013\\n\\n(https://www.sccgov.0rg/sites/phd/hi/hd/DocumentsﬂGBTS 2%20Report%202012H4GBTS 2\\nReport WEB.pdf ) indicated the following:\\n\\nPage 1 of 5County of Santa Clara Bid RFP—BHS—FY19—0168\\nRFP—BHS-FY19-0168: Ethnic/Cultural Communities Advisory Committee for LGBTQ Outreach and Engagement Program\\n\\nATTACHMEN T A\\n\\n1. There is diversity within the LGBTQ communities in terms of age, gender, sex assigned\\nat birth, socioeconomic status, education, religious upbringing, and ethnic/racial\\nbackgrounds.\\n\\n2. Mental health and substance use are major concerns and are often caused by the\\nexperience of rejection, isolation, stigma, and discrimination.\\n\\n3. There is a need for services that increase self-acceptance, reduce intimate partner\\nViolence, decrease bullying in schools, and include suicide prevention and sexual health\\neducation.\\n\\n4. There are barriers in accessing culturally appropriate, sensitive services, competent\\nservices, and resources in support of mental health.\\n\\n5. There is a great need for culturally competent mental health providers who are LGBTQ-\\nfriendly and LGBTQ-knowledgeable.\\n\\n6. There is a need for community events and educational campaigns that increase the\\nvisibility of the LGBTQ community, community cohesion, and foster self and social\\nacceptance.\\n\\nIII. Target Population/Geographical Area\\n\\nThe target population is unserved or underserved LGBTQ individuals and families of diverse age\\ngroups and cultural backgrounds within Santa Clara County who are struggling with mental\\nhealth and substance use issues. Currently, services to the LGBTQ community in Santa Clara\\nCounty are more accessible to the Transitional Aged Youth (TAY) and young adult populations.\\nThere is a need for culturally competent services to reach other age groups, including the adult\\nand older adult populations. The target population for this ECCAC program are LGBTQ\\nindividuals of all age groups and diverse backgrounds, including the individual’s family, friends,\\nand support networks.\\n\\nIV. Program Goals, Objectives, and Outcomes\\n\\nThe goals, intended outcomes, and service strategies of the ECCAC for LGBTQ program are\\nbased on the Mental Health Services Act, Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) Project 1 plan\\n\\n(https://www.sccgov.org/sites/bhd/info/PeerSupport/ECCAC/Pages/default.aspx and\\nhtt s://www.scc ov.or sites/bhd/AboutUs/MHSA/Documents/2017/ado ted-f 17-mhsa-ann-\\n\\nupdate-and-new-inn-proj-draft-plan-09-26-17.pdf).\\nA. The ECCAC program goals are:\\n\\n1. To reduce disparities in access to services among underserved cultural populations due to\\nstigma, discrimination and lack of knowledge about mental health services; and\\n\\n2. To help make the public behavioral health system more culturally competent and client\\nand family driven.\\n\\nB. The intended outcomes for clients and families are:\\n1.

Services should address the health disparities as noted in the Califomia LGBTQ Reducing Mental Health Disparities Population Report (2014): “LGBTQ individuals are seen as living outside the norm of expected heterosexual and assigned gender behavior, and therefore may and do experience stigma, discrimination and oppression from government, health systems, school systems, religious institutions, employers, family members, and society at large.” Proposers shall have in-depth knowledge and understanding of the behavioral health needs of the LGBTQ community, demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the value of peer support services, and possess expertise in providing services that support LGBTQ individuals with mental health and/or substance use challenges.

The program emphasizes respect, cooperation, collaboration with organizations in the community, resourcefulness, and creativity.
