Any questions regarding this RFP\\nshould be submitted through the Portal.\\n\\nSECTION II — BACKGROUND\\nA. Air District Overview\\n\\nThe Bay Area Air Quality Management District (Air District) was created by the California\\nLegislature in 1955 as the first regional agency to deal with air pollution in California. The\\nAir District jurisdiction includes Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, Santa Clara, San\\nFrancisco, San Mateo, southwestern Solano, and southern Sonoma counties.\\n\\nThe State Legislature originally gave the Air District the authority to regulate stationary\\nsources of air pollution, such as factories, oil refineries, chemical plants, gasoline\\nstations, and agricultural burning. With more recent legislation, the Air District was\\ngranted authority to enact certain transportation and mobile source measures. In 2017,\\nthe Air District adopted a Clean Air Plan, a multi-pollutant strategy to reduce ozone,\\nparticulate matter, toxic air contaminants, and greenhouse gases. The strategy includes\\nproposed regulations, grant and incentive programs, public education and outreach, and\\npartnerships with other agencies and stakeholders.\\n\\nThe Air District is governed by a twenty-four member Board of Directors, consisting of\\nelected officials, including county supervisors, mayors, and city council members. The\\nExecutive Officer / Air Pollution Control Officer for the Air District is Jack Broadbent.\\n\\nB. Technology Implementation Office\\n\\nAs part of the Clean Air Plan’s vision for a post-carbon Bay Area by 2050, the Air District\\nestablished the Technology Implementation Office (TIO) in 2016 to scale up\\ntechnologies that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The TIO plans to\\nincentivize stationary sources of GHG emissions to incorporate |ow-carbon intensity\\npractices across Bay Area industries. The TIO also supports deployment of zero\\nemissions energy generation, zero emissions vehicles and infrastructure, efficiency\\ntechnologies, and new smart/connected technologies, leveraging technology and\\ninnovation opportunities from the Bay Area whenever feasible.\\n\\nThe selected organization will perform a technology assessment to evaluate\\nopportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at stationary sources of air pollution\\nin the Bay Area (e.g. refineries, natural gas power plants, manufacturing facilities, waste\\nmanagement facilities, residential and commercial buildings, etc.). The technology\\nassessment will evaluate technology readiness, costs, benefits, and barriers to\\ndevelopment, demonstration, and deployment. The technology assessment for\\nstationary sources will be used together with existing analyses of transportation\\ntechnologies to support planning for TIO and Air District programs. The results of the\\nassessment will also be shared with partner agencies, researchers, and the private\\nsector.Technology Assessment, GHG Emissions at Stationary Sources RFP 2017-011\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2017\\n\\nSECTION III — INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS\\n\\nA.

If\\nthe Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions\\nnot using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on—line reverse auctioning to conduct\\nprice negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply.\\n(a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on—line\\nauction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each offeror. These prices\\nwill be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in\\naccordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation.\\n(b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using on—line reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or\\nhis/her representative will provide offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the on—line auction\\nprocess. The Government intends to use a commercial web—based product to conduct the reverse auction.\\n(c) Prior to or simultaneously with conducting the on—line reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the\\nofferors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing.\\n(d) The lowest offerors price(s) for each round of the reverse auction will be disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having\\nauthorized access to the on—line auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offerors identity will be concealed from other\\nofferors (although it will be known to the Government; only a generic identifier will be used for each offerors proposed pricing, such\\nas offeror A or lowest—priced offeror). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the\\nreverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction.\\n(e) The reverse auction system currently in use designates offers as \"Lead,\" meaning the current low price in that auction, or \"Not\\nLead,\" meaning not the current low price in that auction. In the event of a tie offer, the reverse auction provider\\'s system designates\\nthe first offer of that price as \"Lead\" and the second or subsequent offer of that price as \"Not Lead.\" offerors shall not submit a tie\\noffer, since this is inconsistent with the purpose of the reverse auction. If a tie offer is submitted, the \"Not Lead\" offeror that\\nsubmitted the tie offer must offer a changed price; it will be ineligible for award if the final price in the auction is the tie offer\\nprice.\\n(f) An offerors final auction price at the close of the reverse auction will be considered its final proposal revision. No price\\nrevisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are\\nneeded and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.307, or the\\nContracting Officer determines that it would be in the best interest of the Government to re—open the auction.\\n\\n(g) The following information is provided regarding the procedures to be followed if a reverse auction is conducted.\\n\\n(1) Each offeror identified by the Contracting Officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by Defense Logistic\\nAgencys commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the offeror of the event and to provide an explanation of the process.\\n\\n(2) In order for an offeror to participate in the reverse auction, such offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire\\nsolicitation, including this provision, and agree to the commercial reverse auction service providers terms and conditions for using its\\nservice. Information concerning the reverse auction process and the commercial service providers terms and conditions is embedded within\\nthe email notification sent by the on—line reverse auction pricing tool system administrator.\\n\\n(3) offerors shall secure the passwords and other confidential materials provided by the commercial reverse auction service provider or\\nthe Government and ensure they are used only for purposes of participation in the reverse auction. offerors shall keep their own and\\nother offerors pricing in confidence until after contract award.\\n\\n(4) Any offeror unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service providers system during a reverse auction must\\nnotify the Contracting Officer or designated representative immediately. The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend\\nor re—open the reverse auction if the reason for the offerors inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part\\nof the offeror and outside the offerors control.\\n\\n(5) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service providers website as embedded in the email\\nnotification. offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and internet connection.\\n\\n(6) Training:\\n\\n(i) The commercial reverse auction service provider will provide familiarization training to offerors employees; this training may be\\nprovided through written material, the commercial reverse auction service providers website, and/or other means.\\n\\n(ii) An employee of an offeror who successfully completes the training shall be designated as a \\'trained offeror.’ Only trained offerors\\nmay participate in a reverse auction. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request that offerors provide an alternate offeror\\nemployee to become a \\'trained offeror.’ The Contracting Officer also reserves the right to take away the \\'trained offeror\\' designation\\n\\nfrom any trained offeror who fails to abide by the solicitations or commercial reverse auction service providers terms and conditions.\\n\\n(End of Provision)\\n\\n115 52.233—9000 AGENCY PROTESTS APR/2009\\n(DLAD)\\n\\nCompanies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3)\\npursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity\\'s Chief of the Contracting Office.

Please note the changes\\nand questions received and submit your proposal accordingly.\\n\\nChanges\\n\\nSection D, Page 15, Item no.10.2.3, delete “at a rate of at least (seven) 7 per week.” and replace with “at a\\nrate of at least four to six per week.”\\n\\nQuestions\\n\\n1.\\n\\nHow is the County going to pursue the homeowners that take part in the program? How Will the\\nCounty advertise?\\n\\nAnswer: Howard County has contacted all known leaders of Home Owners’ Associations in the\\nproject area, inviting them to attend a presentation or arrange an individual presentation about the\\nprogram. The County is currently in the process of speaking With communities who responded to this\\nmailing. Howard County has created a social marketing plan to assess the best methods to reach\\nindividuals in this community. The County is currently taking steps to implement some of the\\nsuggestions put fOIth in this plan, such as a rain garden commercial Which may air on major networks,\\ndepending upon funding availability. Howard County has engaged several community groups,\\nincluding the Watershed Stewards Academy, the Watershed Improvement Network, and the Earth\\nForum to aid in spreading infonnation about this program. The County has already begun to receive\\nnames of interested patties as the result of these efforts. Howard County hopes to make local real\\nestate agents aware of this opportunity.\\n\\nIs there a minimum size proj ect per house based on dollar value or square footage of storm water\\nmitigated?\\n\\nAnswer: The following amounts of impervious surface, depending upon lot size and type, must be\\ntreated by proposed projects. Treatment of impervious surface and sizing of practices must be\\ndetennined based upon Environmental Site Design equations found in the Maryland DepaItment of\\nEnvironment Stonnwater Design Manual, chapter 5.\\n\\nCondominium or Townhouse: 250 square feet of impervious surface\\nSingle family home on 1%: acre or less: 500 square feet of impervious surface\\nSingle family home on greater than 1%: acre: 1000 square feet of impervious surface\\n\\nRFP-18-2016 Page 1 of 3 Addendum No. 2We have not detennined a dollar value maximum per amount of impervious surface treated or size of\\nproj ect; however, this will be a consideration among firms who meet the technical requirements and\\nproceed to price proposals.\\n\\n3. How imp01tant is it for this money to be distributed over 50 separate houses?\\nAnswer: 50 is an approximation of the homes that we believe can be reached with the available\\nfunding; however, we desire that the available funding be distributed to the largest number of\\nhomeowners without sacriﬁcing product quality or customer service.\\n\\n4. If we cannot meet deadlines for installation due to bad weather, plants not available etc. will we be\\npenalized?\\nAnswer: No, as long as best efforts have been made to communicate these difﬁculties to the County\\nand the County believes that a reasonable effort has been made to meet deadlines for installation.\\n\\n5. What are the qualiﬁcations of the County personnel running this program? Do we need to educate\\nthem or are they knowledgeable about BMPs, rain gardens, bio—swales, plant material?\\nAnswer: The County Proj ect Manager has been trained on appropriate BMP placement, construction,\\nand maintenance through at least 40 hours of in—the—ﬁeld inspections accompanied by a University of\\nMaryland Extension Watershed Restoration Specialist. The Project Manager has also attended\\nnumerous BMP maintenance and design seminars to provide additional training and sits on the\\nAdvisory Committee of the Howard County Watershed Stewards Committee, as well as the\\nChesapeake Bay Landscaping Professional Technical Advisory Committee. The Office of\\nCommunity Sustainability has numerous community and technical connections, especially as it\\npertains to stormwater management, that will help ensure the success of this program.\\n\\n6. Can we charge administrative fees for having to gather and enter documentation data into\\n\\numdseagrant.appspot.com?\\nAnswer: No. The County will only accept charges for construction of the rain garden, rain barrel, and\\n\\ntree planting proj ects.\\n\\n7. We have installed projects for Anne Arundel County Watershed Stewardship — Clean Water\\nCommunities project. They were the contact people for the individual homeowners and they\\n“bundled” projects such as 5 houses in close proximity being installed at the same time. It made it\\nmuch more cost efﬁcient for us to perfonn this work. Is there potential for this program to be run the\\nsame way?\\n\\nAnswer: We are open to discussion of this possibility. However, our highest priority is responsive\\ncustomer service; we would like to avoid residents remaining on a waiting list for long periods of\\ntime.\\n\\n8. On the Howard County website there is a power point presentation titled Howard County Cleanscapes\\nHoward County BMP Residential Stonnwater BMP Financial Incentive Program. There is a list of\\npreferred landscape contractors. Where did you get the list?\\n\\nAnswer: The list that you refer to contains landscapers who have performed work in Howard County\\nthat meet our ﬁnancial incentive criteria; this is merely for residents’ reference and is not intended as\\nan endorsement or certification.\\n\\n9. Currently we do not have professional liability insurance. Would this disqualify us from this\\nprogram?\\nAnswer: Once notiﬁcation of award is made, the contractor must provide evidence that they have\\nprofessional liability insurance.\\n\\nRFP-18-2016 Page 2 of 3 Addendum No. 210. We currently do not have a plant dealer’s license but are looking into getting one. Would we be able\\nto include a photocopy of our Plant Dealers License with our application as proof?\\nAnswer: Please refer to Section D, Item no. 5.4.\\n\\n11. What will the customer ﬂow be like (all at once, steadily and ongoing, etc.)? For example, say a large\\n\\nnumber of customers do not sign up until late in the program. Would we be able to adjust/extend the\\nschedule to accommodate?\\nAnswer: We are uncertain and believe it would be inaccurate to postulate. You must be able to\\naccomplish the rate of installation speciﬁed within this RFP during the entire length of this program.\\nIf we develop a sizable waiting list, we expect you to make all efforts to respond to customers and\\naccomplish work as quickly as possible without sacriﬁcing quality or customer service; however, we\\nexpect that, at a minimum, you will be able to perfonn the specified rate of BMP installation\\nthroughout the length of the proj ect.\\n\\nPlease acknowledge addenda by signing below and retuming with the bid.

The Commission is committed to taking all reasonable steps to eliminate obstacles to the\\nparticipation of DBEs and other small business concerns as prime contractors or subcontractors in\\nCommission procurements.\\n\\nIt is also the Commission’s policy:\\n\\n1. to ensure nondiscrimination against any person or company because of race, creed, color, sex, age\\nor national origin in the award or performance of any contract subject to the requirements of 49\\nCFR Part 26;\\n\\n2. to create a level playing field on Which DBEs and other small businesses can compete fairly for\\nDOT—assisted contracts;\\n\\n3. to ensure that its DBE program is narrowly tailored in accordance With applicable law;\\n\\n4. to ensure that only ﬁrms that fully meet 49 CFR Part 26 eligibility standards are permitted to\\nparticipate as DBEs;\\n\\n5. to help remove barriers to the participation of DBEs and other small businesses in DOT—assisted\\ncontracts; and\\n\\n6. to assist in the development of ﬁrms that can compete successfully in the marketplace outside the\\nDBE Program.\\n\\nThe Commission’s DBE Program applies only to Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funded\\nprojects.\\n\\nThe Commission encourages businesses that may qualify as DBEs to seek DBE certiﬁcation.\\nBusinesses not certiﬁed as DBEs do not count toward the Commission’s DBE participation\\nachievements in its AlP funded proj ects.\\n\\nF irms interested in applying for DBE certification should contact either the Virginia Department of\\nSmall Business and Supplier Diversity (http://sbsd.Virginia.gov) or the Metropolitan Washington\\nAirports Authority (www.mwaa.com).

Any questions regarding this RFP\\nshould be submitted through the Portal.\\n\\nSECTION II — BACKGROUND\\nA. Air District Overview\\n\\nThe Bay Area Air Quality Management District (Air District) was created by the California\\nLegislature in 1955 as the first regional agency to deal with air pollution in California. The\\nAir District jurisdiction includes Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, Santa Clara, San\\nFrancisco, San Mateo, southwestern Solano, and southern Sonoma counties.\\n\\nThe State Legislature originally gave the Air District the authority to regulate stationary\\nsources of air pollution, such as factories, oil refineries, chemical plants, gasoline\\nstations, and agricultural burning. With more recent legislation, the Air District was\\ngranted authority to enact certain transportation and mobile source measures. In 2017,\\nthe Air District adopted a Clean Air Plan, a multi-pollutant strategy to reduce ozone,\\nparticulate matter, toxic air contaminants, and greenhouse gases. The strategy includes\\nproposed regulations, grant and incentive programs, public education and outreach, and\\npartnerships with other agencies and stakeholders.\\n\\nThe Air District is governed by a twenty-four member Board of Directors, consisting of\\nelected officials, including county supervisors, mayors, and city council members. The\\nExecutive Officer / Air Pollution Control Officer for the Air District is Jack Broadbent.\\n\\nB. Technology Implementation Office\\n\\nAs part of the Clean Air Plan’s vision for a post-carbon Bay Area by 2050, the Air District\\nestablished the Technology Implementation Office (TIO) in 2016 to scale up\\ntechnologies that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The TIO plans to\\nincentivize stationary sources of GHG emissions to incorporate |ow-carbon intensity\\npractices across Bay Area industries. The TIO also supports deployment of zero\\nemissions energy generation, zero emissions vehicles and infrastructure, efficiency\\ntechnologies, and new smart/connected technologies, leveraging technology and\\ninnovation opportunities from the Bay Area whenever feasible.\\n\\nThe selected organization will perform a technology assessment to evaluate\\nopportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at stationary sources of air pollution\\nin the Bay Area (e.g. refineries, natural gas power plants, manufacturing facilities, waste\\nmanagement facilities, residential and commercial buildings, etc.). The technology\\nassessment will evaluate technology readiness, costs, benefits, and barriers to\\ndevelopment, demonstration, and deployment. The technology assessment for\\nstationary sources will be used together with existing analyses of transportation\\ntechnologies to support planning for TIO and Air District programs. The results of the\\nassessment will also be shared with partner agencies, researchers, and the private\\nsector.Technology Assessment, GHG Emissions at Stationary Sources RFP 2017-011\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2017\\n\\nSECTION III — INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS\\n\\nA.

If\\nthe Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions\\nnot using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on—line reverse auctioning to conduct\\nprice negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply.\\n(a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on—line\\nauction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each offeror. These prices\\nwill be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in\\naccordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation.\\n(b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using on—line reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or\\nhis/her representative will provide offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the on—line auction\\nprocess. The Government intends to use a commercial web—based product to conduct the reverse auction.\\n(c) Prior to or simultaneously with conducting the on—line reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the\\nofferors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing.\\n(d) The lowest offerors price(s) for each round of the reverse auction will be disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having\\nauthorized access to the on—line auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offerors identity will be concealed from other\\nofferors (although it will be known to the Government; only a generic identifier will be used for each offerors proposed pricing, such\\nas offeror A or lowest—priced offeror). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the\\nreverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction.\\n(e) The reverse auction system currently in use designates offers as \"Lead,\" meaning the current low price in that auction, or \"Not\\nLead,\" meaning not the current low price in that auction. In the event of a tie offer, the reverse auction provider\\'s system designates\\nthe first offer of that price as \"Lead\" and the second or subsequent offer of that price as \"Not Lead.\" offerors shall not submit a tie\\noffer, since this is inconsistent with the purpose of the reverse auction. If a tie offer is submitted, the \"Not Lead\" offeror that\\nsubmitted the tie offer must offer a changed price; it will be ineligible for award if the final price in the auction is the tie offer\\nprice.\\n(f) An offerors final auction price at the close of the reverse auction will be considered its final proposal revision. No price\\nrevisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are\\nneeded and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.307, or the\\nContracting Officer determines that it would be in the best interest of the Government to re—open the auction.\\n\\n(g) The following information is provided regarding the procedures to be followed if a reverse auction is conducted.\\n\\n(1) Each offeror identified by the Contracting Officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by Defense Logistic\\nAgencys commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the offeror of the event and to provide an explanation of the process.\\n\\n(2) In order for an offeror to participate in the reverse auction, such offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire\\nsolicitation, including this provision, and agree to the commercial reverse auction service providers terms and conditions for using its\\nservice. Information concerning the reverse auction process and the commercial service providers terms and conditions is embedded within\\nthe email notification sent by the on—line reverse auction pricing tool system administrator.\\n\\n(3) offerors shall secure the passwords and other confidential materials provided by the commercial reverse auction service provider or\\nthe Government and ensure they are used only for purposes of participation in the reverse auction. offerors shall keep their own and\\nother offerors pricing in confidence until after contract award.\\n\\n(4) Any offeror unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service providers system during a reverse auction must\\nnotify the Contracting Officer or designated representative immediately. The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend\\nor re—open the reverse auction if the reason for the offerors inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part\\nof the offeror and outside the offerors control.\\n\\n(5) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service providers website as embedded in the email\\nnotification. offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and internet connection.\\n\\n(6) Training:\\n\\n(i) The commercial reverse auction service provider will provide familiarization training to offerors employees; this training may be\\nprovided through written material, the commercial reverse auction service providers website, and/or other means.\\n\\n(ii) An employee of an offeror who successfully completes the training shall be designated as a \\'trained offeror.’ Only trained offerors\\nmay participate in a reverse auction. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request that offerors provide an alternate offeror\\nemployee to become a \\'trained offeror.’ The Contracting Officer also reserves the right to take away the \\'trained offeror\\' designation\\n\\nfrom any trained offeror who fails to abide by the solicitations or commercial reverse auction service providers terms and conditions.\\n\\n(End of Provision)\\n\\n115 52.233—9000 AGENCY PROTESTS APR/2009\\n(DLAD)\\n\\nCompanies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3)\\npursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity\\'s Chief of the Contracting Office.

Please note the changes\\nand questions received and submit your proposal accordingly.\\n\\nChanges\\n\\nSection D, Page 15, Item no.10.2.3, delete “at a rate of at least (seven) 7 per week.” and replace with “at a\\nrate of at least four to six per week.”\\n\\nQuestions\\n\\n1.\\n\\nHow is the County going to pursue the homeowners that take part in the program? How Will the\\nCounty advertise?\\n\\nAnswer: Howard County has contacted all known leaders of Home Owners’ Associations in the\\nproject area, inviting them to attend a presentation or arrange an individual presentation about the\\nprogram. The County is currently in the process of speaking With communities who responded to this\\nmailing. Howard County has created a social marketing plan to assess the best methods to reach\\nindividuals in this community. The County is currently taking steps to implement some of the\\nsuggestions put fOIth in this plan, such as a rain garden commercial Which may air on major networks,\\ndepending upon funding availability. Howard County has engaged several community groups,\\nincluding the Watershed Stewards Academy, the Watershed Improvement Network, and the Earth\\nForum to aid in spreading infonnation about this program. The County has already begun to receive\\nnames of interested patties as the result of these efforts. Howard County hopes to make local real\\nestate agents aware of this opportunity.\\n\\nIs there a minimum size proj ect per house based on dollar value or square footage of storm water\\nmitigated?\\n\\nAnswer: The following amounts of impervious surface, depending upon lot size and type, must be\\ntreated by proposed projects. Treatment of impervious surface and sizing of practices must be\\ndetennined based upon Environmental Site Design equations found in the Maryland DepaItment of\\nEnvironment Stonnwater Design Manual, chapter 5.\\n\\nCondominium or Townhouse: 250 square feet of impervious surface\\nSingle family home on 1%: acre or less: 500 square feet of impervious surface\\nSingle family home on greater than 1%: acre: 1000 square feet of impervious surface\\n\\nRFP-18-2016 Page 1 of 3 Addendum No. 2We have not detennined a dollar value maximum per amount of impervious surface treated or size of\\nproj ect; however, this will be a consideration among firms who meet the technical requirements and\\nproceed to price proposals.\\n\\n3. How imp01tant is it for this money to be distributed over 50 separate houses?\\nAnswer: 50 is an approximation of the homes that we believe can be reached with the available\\nfunding; however, we desire that the available funding be distributed to the largest number of\\nhomeowners without sacriﬁcing product quality or customer service.\\n\\n4. If we cannot meet deadlines for installation due to bad weather, plants not available etc. will we be\\npenalized?\\nAnswer: No, as long as best efforts have been made to communicate these difﬁculties to the County\\nand the County believes that a reasonable effort has been made to meet deadlines for installation.\\n\\n5. What are the qualiﬁcations of the County personnel running this program? Do we need to educate\\nthem or are they knowledgeable about BMPs, rain gardens, bio—swales, plant material?\\nAnswer: The County Proj ect Manager has been trained on appropriate BMP placement, construction,\\nand maintenance through at least 40 hours of in—the—ﬁeld inspections accompanied by a University of\\nMaryland Extension Watershed Restoration Specialist. The Project Manager has also attended\\nnumerous BMP maintenance and design seminars to provide additional training and sits on the\\nAdvisory Committee of the Howard County Watershed Stewards Committee, as well as the\\nChesapeake Bay Landscaping Professional Technical Advisory Committee. The Office of\\nCommunity Sustainability has numerous community and technical connections, especially as it\\npertains to stormwater management, that will help ensure the success of this program.\\n\\n6. Can we charge administrative fees for having to gather and enter documentation data into\\n\\numdseagrant.appspot.com?\\nAnswer: No. The County will only accept charges for construction of the rain garden, rain barrel, and\\n\\ntree planting proj ects.\\n\\n7. We have installed projects for Anne Arundel County Watershed Stewardship — Clean Water\\nCommunities project. They were the contact people for the individual homeowners and they\\n“bundled” projects such as 5 houses in close proximity being installed at the same time. It made it\\nmuch more cost efﬁcient for us to perfonn this work. Is there potential for this program to be run the\\nsame way?\\n\\nAnswer: We are open to discussion of this possibility. However, our highest priority is responsive\\ncustomer service; we would like to avoid residents remaining on a waiting list for long periods of\\ntime.\\n\\n8. On the Howard County website there is a power point presentation titled Howard County Cleanscapes\\nHoward County BMP Residential Stonnwater BMP Financial Incentive Program. There is a list of\\npreferred landscape contractors. Where did you get the list?\\n\\nAnswer: The list that you refer to contains landscapers who have performed work in Howard County\\nthat meet our ﬁnancial incentive criteria; this is merely for residents’ reference and is not intended as\\nan endorsement or certification.\\n\\n9. Currently we do not have professional liability insurance. Would this disqualify us from this\\nprogram?\\nAnswer: Once notiﬁcation of award is made, the contractor must provide evidence that they have\\nprofessional liability insurance.\\n\\nRFP-18-2016 Page 2 of 3 Addendum No. 210. We currently do not have a plant dealer’s license but are looking into getting one. Would we be able\\nto include a photocopy of our Plant Dealers License with our application as proof?\\nAnswer: Please refer to Section D, Item no. 5.4.\\n\\n11. What will the customer ﬂow be like (all at once, steadily and ongoing, etc.)? For example, say a large\\n\\nnumber of customers do not sign up until late in the program. Would we be able to adjust/extend the\\nschedule to accommodate?\\nAnswer: We are uncertain and believe it would be inaccurate to postulate.
